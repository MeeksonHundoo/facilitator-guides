# Course Overview

### Syllabus

The following provides key information for the ENGL 101 modules (schedules, activity instructions, etc.). Please see the full course notes on Moodle.

### Course Description
This course is designed to guide students through the writing and research tasks of the university classroom in order to equip them with confidence and the ability to write in a variety of academic genres, including the research paper. Students expand critical thinking skills through reading and writing cognitively complex arguments while also exploring academic voice, style, and vocabulary. 

NOTE: This course focuses on writing with research. Students will be immersed in reading and writing about a topic of their choice within the general theme of “social and environmental justice.”

### Course Design

This is a skill-based course. It requires students’ active participation, discussions, and inquires. Class activities are designed for you to apply the skill set(s) that you gain in each lesson to small group or your individual writing tasks. The class activities scaffolded step by step in each module can guide you to better outline and write your main essays logically. During the process of writing from a worksheet (i.e. essay outline) to a final draft, you will receive your professor’s feedback. Your learning coach is also a partner in this course.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to demonstrate:
1. Through discovering the expectations for writing in multiple disciplines, students will begin to 
encounter scholarly **complexity**.
2. Through identifying bias and credibility, students will develop **cognitive complexity** and a sense of **social responsibility**.
3. Through critically reading and interacting with research and text, students will develop **cognitive complexity and interpretive methodology**.
4. Through writing in a variety of academic genres, students will develop **reasoning and analytical skills**, equipping them to become **informed and competent leaders** in their chosen discipline in the future.
5. Through uncovering relevant research and integrating evidence effectively, students will develop **information literacy, critical thinking skills, integrity, social responsibility, and knowledge of academic conventions.**
6. Through formulating a research question and practicing inquiry from multiple source types, students will develop **autonomy** and **personal voice.**
7. Through constructing effective thesis statements, students will learn to articulate **their opinions and perspectives.**
8. Through carrying out and communicating sound research, organizing arguments in a research paper, writing research notes, drafting and revising research paragraphs, students will develop **confidence, self-monitoring, and metacognition.**

### Course Activities/Requirements:

1. You are strongly encouraged to have access to a computer at home with reliable internet. 
2. Lab attendance and active participation are essential in this class. You must come to the lab at 6:00-7:30am on Tuesdays and Thursdays (Vancouver time). Your professor and facilitator expect you to communicate as soon as possible if you are not able to attend the lab or if you have any questions/concerns. Your lab attendance will be recorded by your facilitator.
3. You must complete all readings and video lessons as assigned and be prepared for each lab.
4. Your professor expect you to communicate if you are falling behind or if you have any questions. She will be happy to make an appointment with you any time, so email me first. She can meet you via Zoom synchronously.
5. In case of the VPN disruption, students are responsible for finding a way to inform their professor and facilitator immediately about their situation. Without this prompt communication, accommodations such as an extension of major assignments and exemption of the attendance policy will not be offered.
6. The real learning in this course happens when you apply the lessons. Every week, you must complete one step or activity based on the lessons. This includes all stages of your inquiry, including your critical thinking, your research, your thesis and organization, and your drafting and revision. Note: Active participation in all formative work is required prior to the submission of a final draft. Your final draft will not be graded unless you have participated fully in the course activities.
7. Students will explore how to paraphrase and use research responsibly. 

### Course Texts:

• ENGL 101 e-books of Module 1~4 (2022 SP). Langley, BC: Trinity Western University.

• Additional materials will be posted on Moodle as needed or provided in class.

### Facilitation Guide: Introduction


This guide will give you an overview of the course, including the syllabus, suggested facilitation strategies, and instructor notes.
Please also review in detail the course contents in Moodle.
Another key resource for every Facilitator is the TWU Faculty instructor of record. Please ensure you have set up a meeting weeks before the class begins to go over course details and schedule.

In this section, we will outline a couple of key ideas to consider as you facilitate this course.  See below for advice on setting up your class schedule, facilitating activities and discussions, and guiding students through assessments.

### Class Schedule
Note that students will do part of the learning online, and part in the Facilitated Learning Lab.  This is a flipped classroom model where students engage with the content at home by reading the textbook, reading and viewing the course materials on Moodle as designed by the instructor, and preparing activities and assignments.  In their Facilitated Learning Lab, they will engage in group discussions, assignments, and other activities in order to help them further engage with the course material.  

### Online Activities
Before each class, students are encouraged to view the entire unit that will be discussed that week.  They need to read the unit content provided by the instructor and engage in several learning activities.  As you preview the week ahead with your class, point out activities that they must complete before they come to your class.

### Lab Assignments & Learning Activities
Note that many Labs will be devoted to certain assignments and activities.  On the next pages are details for the lessons and assignments. Please refer to the course in Moodle for specifics.

b. Read the instructions for students. Doublecheck if students have watched my APA template tutorial video. If many students hadn’t watched it, play my tutorial video for them. Afterwards, ask students to create their own APA template. The authorship of the file should be their official name. For those who took WRTG 101 last term, they can “update” their APA template that they created last term. That should be fine.
