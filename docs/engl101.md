### Course Overview

### Syllabus

The following provides key information for the ENGL 101 modules (schedules, activity instructions, etc.). Please see the full course notes on Moodle.

### Course Description
This course is designed to guide students through the writing and research tasks of the university classroom in order to equip them with confidence and the ability to write in a variety of academic genres, including the research paper. Students expand critical thinking skills through reading and writing cognitively complex arguments while also exploring academic voice, style, and vocabulary. 

NOTE: This course focuses on writing with research. Students will be immersed in reading and writing about a topic of their choice within the general theme of “social and environmental justice.”

### Course Design

This is a skill-based course. It requires students’ active participation, discussions, and inquires. Class activities are designed for you to apply the skill set(s) that you gain in each lesson to small group or your individual writing tasks. The class activities scaffolded step by step in each module can guide you to better outline and write your main essays logically. During the process of writing from a worksheet (i.e. essay outline) to a final draft, you will receive your professor’s feedback. Your learning coach is also a partner in this course.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to demonstrate:
1. Through discovering the expectations for writing in multiple disciplines, students will begin to 
encounter scholarly **complexity**.
2. Through identifying bias and credibility, students will develop **cognitive complexity** and a sense of **social responsibility**.
3. Through critically reading and interacting with research and text, students will develop **cognitive complexity and interpretive methodology**.
4. Through writing in a variety of academic genres, students will develop **reasoning and analytical skills**, equipping them to become **informed and competent leaders** in their chosen discipline in the future.
5. Through uncovering relevant research and integrating evidence effectively, students will develop **information literacy, critical thinking skills, integrity, social responsibility, and knowledge of academic conventions.**
6. Through formulating a research question and practicing inquiry from multiple source types, students will develop **autonomy** and **personal voice.**
7. Through constructing effective thesis statements, students will learn to articulate **their opinions and perspectives.**
8. Through carrying out and communicating sound research, organizing arguments in a research paper, writing research notes, drafting and revising research paragraphs, students will develop **confidence, self-monitoring, and metacognition.**

### Course Activities/Requirements:

1. You are strongly encouraged to have access to a computer at home with reliable internet. 
2. Lab attendance and active participation are essential in this class. You must come to the lab at 6:00-7:30am on Tuesdays and Thursdays (Vancouver time). Your professor and facilitator expect you to communicate as soon as possible if you are not able to attend the lab or if you have any questions/concerns. Your lab attendance will be recorded by your facilitator.
3. You must complete all readings and video lessons as assigned and be prepared for each lab.
4. Your professor expect you to communicate if you are falling behind or if you have any questions. She will be happy to make an appointment with you any time, so email me first. She can meet you via Zoom synchronously.
5. In case of the VPN disruption, students are responsible for finding a way to inform their professor and facilitator immediately about their situation. Without this prompt communication, accommodations such as an extension of major assignments and exemption of the attendance policy will not be offered.
6. The real learning in this course happens when you apply the lessons. Every week, you must complete one step or activity based on the lessons. This includes all stages of your inquiry, including your critical thinking, your research, your thesis and organization, and your drafting and revision. Note: Active participation in all formative work is required prior to the submission of a final draft. Your final draft will not be graded unless you have participated fully in the course activities.
7. Students will explore how to paraphrase and use research responsibly.
