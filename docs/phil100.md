## Unit 1: What is wisdom?
According to Nozick, wisdom helps people to live life well, cope with and respond to the many challenges in life, and, if possible, avoid some of those challenges. So, to live wisely, people need to affirm the right beliefs and practice the right actions. How do we know which beliefs and actions are appropriate for living well? In other words, what are the right beliefs?  What are the right actions?  (15 min + 5 min presentations)

Activity: 1

Introduction Topic 2	

Last week, we learned that knowledge is not sufficient for wisdom because wisdom requires action. Today, we will talk about wisdom and knowledge. There are two ideas associated with wisdom and knowledge to discuss. The first idea is that acquiring knowledge requires the practice of doubting (Do not believe everything you read and hear). The second idea is that a wise person obtains knowledge of the most valuable things in life, such as knowledge about God, science, and morality. According to Descartes, pursuing knowledge of these most valuable things in life is not only good but can enable one to live a better life. (2 min)

Activity 1
	Based on the video in Moodle and this week’s readings, discuss the following questions in your groups (10-15 min + 5 min presentations):
1. Discuss ways in which you can engage in the practice of doubting. Give one example.
2. Do you believe that knowledge is sufficient for wisdom? Why or why not?

Revision Topic 2: Kahoot! (5 min)

Introduction Topic 3

Plato believed that a wise person understands their limitations about what they know and do not know. In other words, a wise person is aware of their ignorance. The word "ignorance" in this case means a lack of knowledge about a particular thing. One application of being aware of ignorance for seeking wisdom is to practice a humble attitude towards the complex issues in life, such as how to interpret the Bible, evolution, the nature of sexuality, and the implications of social media for our lives. A wise person demonstrates humility towards these complex issues by asking thoughtful questions about the opposing view, knowing when to withhold judgment and opinion, and with a willingness to change their mind (1 min).

Revision Topic 3: Kahoot! (5 min)

Introduction Topic 4 

In topic 4, we will explore the relationship between wisdom and bias because this relationship is valuable for seeking humility. Can anyone explain what bias is? In Moodle there are two examples of bias: Social bias, which is a kind of negative attitude and opinion toward others based on their race, gender, age, and so on. What is the other example in Moodle? Cognitive Bias. One form of cognitive bias is called confirmation bias. Confirmation bias is when people attempt to acquire knowledge by consulting evidence that only supports their own agenda.

Revision Unit 5: Kahoot! (5 min)

Introduction Topic 6

Rhetoric refers to the art of persuasion or influence. we discussed how wisdom requires awareness and application of our actions, knowledge, humility, biases, and charity. The art of persuasion involves all of these skills plus the skill of argumentation. We will learn more about argumentation in Unit 2. In topic 6, we will learn that a wise person knows how to argue without fighting. Here are some things to consider before starting an argument: Are you trying to influence someone's decision? Is that feasible? Are you hoping to feel like a winner? After the argument, would you like to maintain the relationship with the person? In what way are you prepared to compromise? What is the purpose of the argument and how should it be achieved?

Group Activity 1

Argument vs. Fight For this activity, you can use the content in Moodle, this week’s reading, and the internet to explain the difference between argument and fight. What are the outcomes of an argument? What are the outcomes of a fight? (15 min + 5min presentation)

Unit 2 Introduction	

An argument is a set of statements organized in a specific way, for example:
1.	All humans are mortal. (Premise)
2.	Lucy is human. (Premise)
3.	Therefore, Lucy is mortal. (Conclusion)

The statements above are organized as an argument because one of the statements, the conclusion, is supported by the other set of statements, the premises.
The premises and conclusion will always be described with statements, and statements are claims that are either true or false.

Non-statements, however, do not express claims that are either true or false, and thus non-statements are never premises or conclusions. Knowing the difference between statements and non-statements is important because that knowledge will help with identifying the parts of the argument. For example:
1.	Apples are red.
2.	Tony Stark is Iron Man.
3.	Was that a magic trick?
4.	Hey, partner!

The first two examples are statements because they express claims that are either true or false. The third example is a question and does not express a claim that is either true or false. Therefore, the third example is a non-statement.

**Unit 2: Session 8 Reason: Topics 5 and 6**

Check-in and Icebreaker: If you could resolve one worldwide problem, what would that be?

**Topic 5 Introduction**	

In Topics 1-4, we learned about the parts of the argument, how to locate keywords, label the parts of the argument (premise and conclusion) with letters in parentheses, and how to restructure the argument vertically with premises at the top and conclusion at the bottom. What happens when there are no keywords for identifying the premise and conclusion? In that case, the reader must interpret the author’s intent and then determine which statements are the premises and conclusion. 

One technique for identifying obscure arguments like the one above is using the “Why/Because” strategy. A conclusion can always be followed by asking a hypothetical “Why?” and a premise can always be introduced with the term “Because.” Show the examples in Moodle

Activity 1 – Topic 5
Learning Activity 2.5: Label and structure the arguments vertically

Demonstrate the exercise by doing 2 examples. Then, arrange the students into teams and ask each team to do the following 8 examples.

**Topic 6 Introduction**

Some arguments use sentences with the terms “If…Then.” These types of sentences are called conditional sentences (or conditionals) and often appear in arguments. For example:
“IF Willy is a whale, THEN Willy is a mammal.”
Note that conditional sentences, while they may include multiple statements, always constitute one premise.

Activity 1 – Topic 6
Learning Activity 2.6: Arguments with conditionals

Go through the examples in Moodle, then let students complete 5 exercises in groups.

Introduction

In Topics 1-4, we learned about the parts of the argument, how to locate keywords, label the parts of the argument (premise and conclusion) with letters in parentheses, and how to restructure the argument vertically with premises at the top and conclusion at the bottom.
In topic 5, we learned that when there are no keywords for identifying the premise and conclusion, the reader must interpret what the author intended to say and then determine which statements are the premises and conclusion. 

One technique for identifying obscure arguments like the one above is using the “Why/Because” strategy. A conclusion can always be followed by asking a hypothetical “Why?” and a premise can always be introduced with the term “Because.” 

In topic 6, we covered the arguments that use sentences with the terms “If…Then.” These types of sentences are called conditional sentences (or conditionals) and often appear in arguments. For example:
“IF Willy is a whale, THEN Willy is a mammal.”
Note that conditional sentences, while they may include multiple statements, always constitute one premise.

In topic 7, we will look at more challenging arguments; they are not only greater length, but the arguments can be difficult to identify. In Moodle, we see some tips for identifying an argument. SHOW MOODLE.
One must carefully sift through the statements to decipher (i) does an argument exist, and (ii) if yes, then what is the conclusion(s) and the premises supporting that conclusion(s)?

Activity 1
Go through the examples in Moodle with the students. Ask them to try to identify the parts of the argument.

Group Activity 1 & 2	
Organize the students into breakout rooms and give them arguments 2 and 3 from the “practice exercise” (15 min). Discuss the answers.

Then, send them again to breakout rooms to work on arguments 4 and 5 (15 min). Discuss the answers.

Reminders:

1. Go through the “practice exercises” this week. Next week, Prof. Andrew will join our facilitation lab and anser any questions you may have. He will also explain the final assignment.
