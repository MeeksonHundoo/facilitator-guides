### Course Activities/Requirements:

1.	Lab attendance and participation are essential in this class. The instructor and facilitator expect you to communicate as soon as possible if you are not able to attend or if you have any questions. To experience dynamic learning, you must participate in all lab activities diligently. **If you miss more than 25% of the lab, you will not be able to write the final exam. (Lab attendance is also required in order to pass the course.)**

2.	Please complete all readings as assigned and be prepared for discussion. **You MUST bring a laptop with you to the lab.** 

3.	You will write **three essays** (1000 words each), one per unit:
    At the end of each unit, you will submit an essay in the designated discipline and genre: one personal response essay (historical and archival); one integration paper         (social and global); and one extended definition (humanities/logical and ethical reasoning); These essays must be final drafts, with careful attention to grammar, sentence     patterns, word use, academic voice, formatting, and documentation. 

4.	You will participate in formative work such as individual activities and lab activities. [NOTE: **Active participation in all formative work is required prior to the submission of a final draft. Your final draft will not be graded unless you have been active in the formative stages (i.e. uploading your worksheet and all your drafts)].**

### Course Schedule

For more syllabus details, including course policies and grading guidelines, see the full syllabus.

### Facilitation Guide: Introduction


This guide will give you an overview of the course, including the syllabus, suggested facilitation strategies, and instructor notes.
Please also review in detail the course contents in Moodle.
Another key resource for every Facilitator is the TWU Faculty instructor of record. Please ensure you have set up a meeting weeks before the class begins to go over course details and schedule.

In this section, we will outline a couple of key ideas to consider as you facilitate this course.  See below for advice on setting up your class schedule, facilitating activities and discussions, and guiding students through assessments.

### Class Schedule
Note that students will do part of the learning online, and part in the Facilitated Learning Lab.  This is a flipped classroom model where students engage with the content at home by reading the textbook, reading and viewing the course materials on Moodle as designed by the instructor, and preparing activities and assignments.  In their Facilitated Learning Lab, they will engage in group discussions, assignments, and other activities in order to help them further engage with the course material.  

### Online Activities
Before each class, students are encouraged to view the entire unit that will be discussed that week.  They need to read the unit content provided by the instructor and engage in several learning activities.  As you preview the week ahead with your class, point out activities that they must complete before they come to your class.

### Lab Assignments & Learning Activities
Note that many Labs will be devoted to certain assignments and activities.  On the next pages are details for the lessons and assignments. Please refer to the course in Moodle for specifics.

    this semester.

2.  Students should install the official Microsoft Word. Please check if
    they have it or not in on the first day of the semester and inform
    that they should be ready to use it for creating APA template in the
    class under your administration.

3.  Students can freely check course materials and watch videos while
    creating their template.

4.  The file title of their APA template should be “APA template
    (Student’s official name)”.

        2.  **Use YOUR APA template** (The failure of using your APA

        3.  **Decide your own title based on the given reading
            article.**

if you have technical difficulties, please talk to your facilitator.\].
You must use your APA template to complete a writing task for the quiz.
If not, the mark of your part 3 will be “0”.

<span style="color:red">**\[NOTEs to the facilitator\]**</span>

  - The quiz materials will be open to the facilitator 1\~2 days earlier
    (This can be negotiated by communications based on the facilitator’s
    situation. This is because school administrators who want their
    students to get a good mark and pass the course might give pressure
    to the facilitator to show the exam materials to them in advance.)

      - After you take attendance, ask students to open their laptop
        and their APA template. Then, you activate the reading PDF link
        for this quiz hidden on the Module 1 page. Be sure that they need
        to refresh their Module 1 page so that they can see the reading
        file that you just activated.

      - As soon as the quiz materials are up, the facilitator can print
        out Part 1 and 2 and prepare Scantron.

      - For Part 3, as soon as students are done with Part 1 and 2,
        collect their exam materials and scantrons. After that, ask them
        to open their laptop and their APA template. Then, you activate
        the Part 3 reading PDF link hidden on the Module 1 page when the
        students are ready to start Part 3. Be sure that they need to
        refresh their Module 1 page so that they can see the Part 3
        reading file that you just activated.

  - <span style="color:red">Let students know this information 1 week earlier.</span>

      - Students should bring their laptop for the test. IF not, they are
        not allowed to take the quiz.
      - Students should use their OWN APA template. IF not, their mark will be “0”.
      - Part 1 and 2 will be done in Scantron. Thus, students also need
        to bring a pencil and eraser.
      - Students should use their OWN APA template for part 3. IF not,
        their mark on part 3 will be “0”.

  - By the END of the exam, students must upload their writing file to the dropbox
    given on the Module 1 course site. **\[IMPORTANT\]:** Please check if they
    successfully upload their file to the given Dropbox or not before they leave
    the classroom.

      - ![](media/image2.png)This dropbox is Turnitin dropbox which is
        different from regular dropbox. You will need to help students
        to activate their Turnitin dropbox one week earlier for the APA
        quiz. Please find time for this in advance.

        <ins>How to activate the Turnitin dropbox?</ins>

        1.  Click the APA quiz dropbox link.

        2.  There will be a message as a blue-link form on the middle of
            the dropbox page. They need to click the link and check the

        3.  Then, they will receive a receipt that can indicate that
            they can submit their file to the dropbox.

      - If students keep getting an error message and cannot activate
        it, direct them to submit their file to the previous APA
        template dropbox where they can save up to 20 files. Then,
        please inform the issue to the instructor by email immediately.
        <br>
  - The facilitator will receive the answer keys within 24 hours, so
    evaluate all the students’ part 1 and 2, and then send the results
    to the instructor by email immediately in 24 hours after the quiz.
