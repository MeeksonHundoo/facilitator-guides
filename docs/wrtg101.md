### Course Schedule

![](Course_Schedule_updated.png)


For more syllabus details, including course policies and grading guidelines, see the full syllabus.

### Facilitation Guide: Introduction


This guide will give you an overview of the course, including the syllabus, suggested facilitation strategies, and instructor notes.
Please also review in detail the course contents in Moodle.
Another key resource for every Facilitator is the TWU Faculty instructor of record. Please ensure you have set up a meeting weeks before the class begins to go over course details and schedule.

In this section, we will outline a couple of key ideas to consider as you facilitate this course.  See below for advice on setting up your class schedule, facilitating activities and discussions, and guiding students through assessments.

### Class Schedule
Note that students will do part of the learning online, and part in the Facilitated Learning Lab.  This is a flipped classroom model where students engage with the content at home by reading the textbook, reading and viewing the course materials on Moodle as designed by the instructor, and preparing activities and assignments.  In their Facilitated Learning Lab, they will engage in group discussions, assignments, and other activities in order to help them further engage with the course material.  

### Online Activities
Before each class, students are encouraged to view the entire unit that will be discussed that week.  They need to read the unit content provided by the instructor and engage in several learning activities.  As you preview the week ahead with your class, point out activities that they must complete before they come to your class.

### Lab Assignments & Learning Activities
Note that many Labs will be devoted to certain assignments and activities.  On the next pages are details for the lessons and assignments. Please refer to the course in Moodle for specifics.

    Writeaway)](https://www.twu.ca/student-life/student-success/writing-centre).
    If you don’t have enough time, please introduce it next class.

  - Attendance (and participation) can be recorded in this file. This
    file can be shared via Google.doc OR MS Teams if preferred by both the
    instructor and facilitator. Please communicate with the instructor.
    This attendance record should be reported to the instructor by the
    last day of the semester.

    (About participation, check Class Activity 1.2 section. Its details
    are given there.)

  - **\[IMPORTANT Announcement to students\]**:

      - The facilitator will take attendance throughout this semester,
        so don’t miss the class. Your class attendance will be counted
        for the final grade of this course. Also, if you miss the class
        over 25%, you are NOT allowed to take a final exam (50%). Check
        the course syllabus for more details.

    APA template to identify their plagiarism issue(s) possible during
    this semester.

2.  Students should install the official Microsoft Word. Please check if
    they have it or not in on the first day of the semester and inform
    that they should be ready to use it for creating APA template in the
    class under your administration.

3.  Students can freely check course materials and watch videos while
    creating their template.

4.  The file title of their APA template should be “APA template
    (Student’s official name)”.

5.  Please check if students’ submissions are appropriately completed
    before they leave the class.

6.  Please take attendance. This will be counted for a participation
    mark.

    dropbox where they can save up to 20 files. Then, please inform the
    issue to the instructor by email immediately.

### Lesson 4: Academic Tone


### <span style="color:blue">Assessment</span>

In Module 1, you participated in a number of lab activities,
including creating an individual APA template, paraphrasing paragraphs
from a website, and making a references list. These three assignments
are to be completed in class and submitted to the instructor via Moodle
Dropbox or Forum pages. Check with your Facilitator for exact dates and
submission instructions.

In addition to the lab activities assignments, there are seven individual
activities, but the Individual Activities 1.1\~1.3 are only graded. You
will receive 5 points for the “completion” of each activity. Please
check the details below.

![](M1_lesson4chart_update.png)

<br>
### <span style="color:blue">APA Quiz: 3%</span>

After you have completed Module 1, you will take an APA quiz on the day of Lab 5.
Please read the details below and study the Module 1 materials and
practice activities. Check with your Facilitator for the exact date of
the exam (Lab 5).

  - **Duration of the exam: Total- 1 hour and 30 minutes.**
  - **The Quiz consists of one** APA writing task- One short article about a Canadian icon will be given.

      - Part 1 & 2: 40 minutes.

      - Part 3: 50 minutes
        <br>
  - **The Quiz consists of:**

      - Part 1: True/False (20 marks)

      - Part 2: Multiple choices- A, B, C, D style (20 marks)

      - Part 3: APA writing task (60 marks)- One short article about a
        Canadian icon will be given.

        1.  **Write ONE paragraph- 150-200 words**

        2.  **Use YOUR APA template** (The failure of using your APA
            template automatically results in "0" mark on the writing
            task. That is, don't borrow your friend's APA template.)

        3.  **Decide your own title based on the given reading
            article.**

        4.  **Essay Type that you need to indicate on your title page is
            APA Essay**

        5.  **Include 2 pieces of evidence** from the given article.

              - *OR two pieces of evidence can be all paraphrased in
                your own words.*

Before this quiz, please be sure that you have revised your APA template
based on my APA tutorial videos and APA Template Setup Checklist \[NOTE:
if you have technical difficulties, please talk to your facilitator.\].
You must use your APA template to complete a writing task for the quiz.
If not, the mark of your part 3 will be “0”.

<span style="color:red">**\[NOTEs to the facilitator\]**</span>

  - The quiz materials will be open to the facilitator 1\~2 days earlier
    (This can be negotiated by communications based on the facilitator’s
    situation. This is because school administrators who want their
    students to get a good mark and pass the course might give pressure
    to the facilitator to show the exam materials to them in advance.)

      - After you take attendance, ask students to open their laptop
        and their APA template. Then, you activate the reading PDF link
        for this quiz hidden on the Module 1 page. Be sure that they need
        to refresh their Module 1 page so that they can see the reading
        file that you just activated.

      - As soon as the quiz materials are up, the facilitator can print
        out Part 1 and 2 and prepare Scantron.

      - For Part 3, as soon as students are done with Part 1 and 2,
        collect their exam materials and scantrons. After that, ask them
        to open their laptop and their APA template. Then, you activate
        the Part 3 reading PDF link hidden on the Module 1 page when the
        students are ready to start Part 3. Be sure that they need to
        refresh their Module 1 page so that they can see the Part 3
        reading file that you just activated.

  - <span style="color:red">Let students know this information 1 week earlier.</span>

      - Students should bring their laptop for the test. IF not, they are
        not allowed to take the quiz.
      - Students should use their OWN APA template. IF not, their mark will be “0”.
      - Part 1 and 2 will be done in Scantron. Thus, students also need
        to bring a pencil and eraser.
      - Students should use their OWN APA template for part 3. IF not,
        their mark on part 3 will be “0”.

  - By the END of the exam, students must upload their writing file to the dropbox
    given on the Module 1 course site. **\[IMPORTANT\]:** Please check if they
    successfully upload their file to the given Dropbox or not before they leave
    the classroom.

      - ![](media/image2.png)This dropbox is Turnitin dropbox which is
        different from regular dropbox. You will need to help students
        to activate their Turnitin dropbox one week earlier for the APA
        quiz. Please find time for this in advance.

        <ins>How to activate the Turnitin dropbox?</ins>

        1.  Click the APA quiz dropbox link.

        2.  There will be a message as a blue-link form on the middle of
            the dropbox page. They need to click the link and check the
            “I agree” box and click “OK”.

        3.  Then, they will receive a receipt that can indicate that
            they can submit their file to the dropbox.

      - If students keep getting an error message and cannot activate
        it, direct them to submit their file to the previous APA
        template dropbox where they can save up to 20 files. Then,
        please inform the issue to the instructor by email immediately.
        <br>
  - The facilitator will receive the answer keys within 24 hours, so
    evaluate all the students’ part 1 and 2, and then send the results
    to the instructor by email immediately in 24 hours after the quiz.

### Module 2: Personal Response

### Activity Checklist

![](M2_Checklist_updated.png)

<br>
<span style="color:red">**[NOTES to the facilitator]:** The First Day of the lab for Module 2 (Lab 1)</span>

  - Explain the Module 2 schedule above and highlight the deadlines of
    M2 worksheet, M2 in-class writing, and M2 final essay.

  - Help students to find THREE important files given on Module 2 page
    in Moodle:

    1.  M2 Personal Response Assignment (Instructions)

    2.  M2 Worksheet (Template)

    3.  M2 Worksheet (Example)

    4.  M2 In-Class Writing template: (Make this hidden file visible to students at the beginning of the Lab 5, before they turn off the wifi. If students do their in-class writing online via Zoom, please ignore the comments on “the wifi” in this facilitator guide. The instruction on the wifi can be applied ONLY when students write their in-class writing in their lab under a facilitator’s supervision face to face.)

  - Introduce the instructions of the Personal Response Assignment. That
    is, READ the instructions for the students. Then, ask students to
    choose ONE topic from the topic list by the next lab.

  - There is also an M2- ongoing dropbox where they can save their essay
    drafts up to 20. Whenever they update/revise their essay, they need
    to save their files such as “M2 draft 1 (Your name)”, and “M2 draft
    2 (Your name)”. The purpose of this “ongoing” Dropbox is to:

    1.  encourage students to work on their essay ‘step by step’ that
        can show a instructor the process of their writing work.

    2.  avoid losing their writing work accidentally. That is, they can
        check this Dropbox to check their previous work, and then
        continue their writing.

    3.  be evidence to prove the originality of their writing work when
        they face an academic dishonesty issue. When those who face the
        plagiarism issue don’t have any files in this ongoing dropbox,
        there will be a consequence based on the weight of their
        plagiarism issue.
        <br>
  - The final essay dropbox will be automatically closed at the due
    time, so encourage students to submit their file on time. When they
    mistakenly submitted a wrong file, the facilitator (or the
    instructor) can delete the wrong file for them and give them a second
    chance to resubmit it “immediately”. When the facilitator deletes
    their wrong file, please send the list of students who resubmitted
    their essay to the instructor by email.

    1.  There might be one or two students whose final essay dropbox
        doesn’t allow them to submit their essay (i.e. technical error).
        In this case, ask them to submit their final essay to their M2
        ongoing dropbox and email the instructor with the essay file,
        too.
     <br>
  - If students had to miss the deadline of the essay due to an urgent
    issue related to “family or severe sickness”, they should
    communicate with the instructor promptly by email. In terms of
    sickness, they will need to provide the instructor with an official
    medical report.

  - Inform that if their late submission becomes a pattern, it will
    result in the 3% deduction of their “final” grade of this course at
    the end of the semester.

  - When they email the instructor, they should indicate their official
    (and English) name, student ID, and class name. Their instructor will
    probably have over 100 students this semester, so it is important to
    indicate their identification clearly.

### Learning Outcomes

When you have completed this module, you should be able to:

  - Explain what personal response is and how to apply it to university
    writing assignments.

  - Distinguish between primary and secondary sources.

  - Sketch the outline of the essay by selecting appropriate evidence to
    support a thesis statement. 

  - Express four different kinds of personal responses based on the
    given primary source.

  - Understand and apply deductive pattern from introduction to
    conclusion.

  - Apply APA formatting/documentation.

    The example thesis statements given in Lesson 5 is related to this
    Lab Activity 1.5, so they can understand how to write a thesis
    statement easily.

7.  <span style="color:red">**Reading homework announcement**:</span>

<!-- end list -->

 a.  Inform that they need to read “M2 Reading 2- PM offers apology,
     symbolic payments for Chinese head tax” for the next class.

 b.  Inform that they need to start working on their M2 Worksheet based
     on “Lesson 4. Thinking Stage” from today. In this stage, they don’t
     have to worry about how to write a thesis statement. They will
     practice it in the next class. Next class, there might be around
     10-20 minute remaining time, so they have a chance to show you (a
     facilitator) their M2 worksheet and write their own thesis in their
     worksheet. If they follow this procedure, they can submit their
     worksheet on time.

**\[NOTE\]:**

  - Please take attendance. This will be counted for a participation
    mark.

  - Please use the excel file that I have given you in Module 1 in order
    to record each student’s contribution to the group work ranged from
    5 to 0. You will need to send the file to the instructor by the end
    of the semester.

  - If the internet is out of service accidentally, you can use the
    article (M2 Reading 1- Individual Activity 1.4) for this class
    activity because the fundamental story of Africville is the same as
    the one described in the video. They will need to submit their
    hand-written work to you as a group, but you need to scan their work
    and send it to the instructor.)

### Module 3: Integration Essay

### Activity Checklist

![](M3_Checklist_updated.png)


**The First Day of the Lab (Lab 1)**

  - For this short announcement, do not spend more than 10 minutes. They
    need to spend the whole class time to complete “Class Activity 1.1”.

  - Explain the Module 3 schedule above and highlight the deadlines of
    M3 worksheet, M3 in-class writing, and M3 final essay.

  - Help students to find TWO important files given on Module 3 page in
    Moodle:

    1.  M3 Integration Essay Assignment (Instructions)

    2.  M3 Worksheet (Template)

    3.  M3 Worksheet (Example): (This hidden link will be open to
        students in Lab 2.)

    4.  The news video link: (This hidden link will be open to students
        in Lab 2.)

          - The case: “[Syrian Refugees in Canada facing challenges
            after one
            year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU7uttRJskE)”

          - This is the case that they should watch in order to write
            their integration paper individually.
    <br> 
    5.  M3 In-Class Writing template: (Make this hidden file visible to
        students at the beginning of Lab 5 before they turn off the wifi. If students do their in-class writing online via Zoom, please ignore the comments on “the wifi” in           this facilitator guide. The instruction on the wifi can be applied ONLY when students write their in-class writing in their lab under a facilitator’s supervision face         to face.)

  - Introduce the instructions of the Integration Essay Assignment and
    show where the files of M3 assignment instructions and worksheet.
    (<span style="color:red">**NOTE**: The news video for the case will be open to students at
    the end of the class on Lab 2.</span>)

*The information below is the ones that you already mentioned in Module 2. However, as a reminder, please inform the information below again “in
short” if necessary:*

  - There is also an M3- ongoing Dropbox where they can save their essay
    drafts up to 20. Whenever they update/revise their essay, they need
    to save their files such as “M3 draft 1 (Your name)”, and “M3 draft
    2 (Your name)”. Even though you already mentioned this in Module 2,
    please remind them about the purpose of this “ongoing” Dropbox
    again:

    1.  encourage students to work on their essay ‘step by step’ that
        can show a instructor the process of their writing work.

    2.  avoid losing their writing work accidentally. That is, they can
        check this Dropbox to check their previous work, and then
        continue their writing.

    3.  be evidence to prove the originality of their writing work when
        they face an academic dishonesty issue. When those who face the
        plagiarism issue don’t have any files in this ongoing dropbox,
        there will be a consequence based on the weight of their
        plagiarism issue.

- The final essay dropbox will be automatically closed at the due
  time, so encourage students to submit their file on time. When they
  mistakenly submitted a wrong file, the facilitator (or the
  instructor) can delete the wrong file for them and give them a second
  chance to resubmit it “immediately”. When the facilitator deletes
  their wrong file, please send the list of students who resubmitted
  their essay to the instructor by email.

    1.  There might be one or two students whose final essay Dropbox
        doesn’t allow them to submit their essay (i.e. technical error).
        In this case, ask them to submit their final essay to their M3
        ongoing dropbox and email the instructor with the essay file,
        too.

-  If students had to miss the deadline of the essay due to an urgent
   issue related to “family or severe sickness”, they should
   communicate with the instructor promptly by email. In terms of
   sickness, they will need to provide the instructor with an official
   medical report.

-  Inform that if their late submission becomes a pattern, it will
   result in the 3% deduction of their “final” grade of this course at
   the end of the semester.

-  When they email the instructor, they should indicate their official
   (and English) name, student ID, and class name. Their instructor will
   probably have over 100 students this semester, so it is important to
   indicate their identification clearly.

### Lesson 2: Thinking Stage

**Lab Activity 1.1 \[Lesson 2- Understanding a Theory\]:** (Group work: 3~4 students per group) 6 wiki pages are needed for this activity/hidden view for students.

**Check your understanding of a theory given in Module 3 with your group
members**. To participate in this activity, you must read the two
articles before the class.

  - **Read** the two articles about Maslow’s theory given in Module 3 in
    advance.

  - You can find which level of the hierarchy of needs in Maslow’s
    theory and the name of your group members on the title of the wiki
    page assigned in Moodle.

      - Physiological needs

      - Safety needs

      - Belongingness and love needs

      - Needs for self-esteem

      - Needs for self-actualization

      - Needs for self-transcendence

  - With your group members, **select the most important theoretical
    concepts in the assigned hierarchy of needs**.

  - **Post** <span class="underline">3~4 important concepts of the
    theory with proper quotation marks and citations to the designated
    wiki page</span> as a group by the end of the class. (NOTE: DO NOT
    paraphrase them, but just copy and paste the concepts with proper
    APA documentation.)

  - <span style="color:red">**\[HOMEWORK for the NEXT class\]:</span>**

      - With your group members, <span style="color:red">**post a 3-minute presentation video to
        the same wiki page** **before the next class**</span>.

      - **Individually, READ all the groups’ postings and WATCH each
        video to understand the entire theory. This is your own
        responsibility to do this homework.**

<span style="color:red">**\[NOTEs to the facilitator\]**</span>

The SIX wiki pages have been hidden, so please make them visible to the
students when they need to do this activity in the class.

1.  Make sure that they have read the two articles in advance.

2.  The instructor will indicate group members’ name directly on the wiki
    links like below.

    ![](M3Image.png)

      - Physiological needs (3~4 students)

      - Safety needs (4~5 students)

      - Belongingness and love needs (2 students)

      - Needs for self-esteem (2 students)

      - Needs for self-actualization (2 students)

      - Needs for self-transcendence (3~4 students)
    <br> 
3. To access the wiki page, they need to click “HTML format” and then
    the button “Create page” like below.

    ![](Image2.png)

4. To post 3~4 quotes from the given article(s), they just need to
    copy and paste the information from the article(s) to the given wiki
    text space and then click the button “SAVE”.

    ![](Image3.png)

5. To re-enter the wiki text space, they need to click the “Edit” tap
    given on the top left.

    ![](Image4.png)

6. **They should NOT paraphrase the theory**. They just need to copy
    and paste the 3~4 most important information of the theory with
    proper quotation marks and citations.

7. If some of the groups finish their wiki task early, encourage them
    to record their 3-minute group presentation. This video presentation
    is informal, so the video should not look fancy. They can use their
    cellphone or laptop camera to deliver the core meaning of their
    theory in the video clearly. Clarity of the content is important.

8. To post the video, they can upload it to Youtube or Google Drive to
    share its link. If these two are not available in their country, the
    facilitator can collect/save the videos to the “Stream” that TWU
    provides you with via Office 365. Then, share their links to the
    wiki pages on behalf of them. (If this doesn’t work for the
    facilitator, please consult with the instructor.)

**\[NOTE\]:**

  - Please take attendance. This will be counted for a participation
    mark.

  - Please use the excel file that I have given you in Module 1 in order
    to record each student’s “contribution” to the group work ranged
    from 5 to 0. You will need to send the file to the instructor by the
    end of the semester.

submit your worksheet to M3 Ongoing dropbox by the end of the class. I
will receive your instructor feedback in 2~3 days.

<span style="color:red">**\[NOTEs to the facilitator\]- <ins>On-campus version**</ins></span>

  - While students are working on their worksheet, check their thesis
    statement if you feel comfortable checking it. You are not
    responsible for their content but can check their grammatical
    issues.

  - If possible, doublecheck if they are using proper sources.

      - Theory: The TWO Maslow’s articles that the instructor has
        provided them with.

      - Case: “[Syrian Refugees in Canada facing challenges after one
        year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU7uttRJskE)”

  - Remind students that M3 in-class writing (8%) will proceed on the
    LAST Lab of Module 3.

<!-- end list -->

  - For 75 minutes, they will write a body paragraph.

  - They will use an M3 in-class writing template provided in Moodle.

  - They should NOT be late or absent on that day.

      - Those who came late for the class will not be given any extra
        time.

      - Absentees will receive a “zero” grade automatically.

<!-- end list -->

  - They should be on time and bring their laptop and a laptop charger.

  - During the in-class writing, they are only allowed to check their
    worksheet and Maslow’s articles.

  - They should turn off the wifi before the in-class writing starts. (On-campus version)

  - They are NOT allowed to use any translators during the in-class
    writing. Using a dictionary is fine.

  - At the end of the lab, ALL the students turn on the wifi (On-campus version), and then
    submit their file to M3 on-going dropbox.

**\[NOTE\]:**

  - Please take attendance. This will be counted for a participation
    mark.

  - Please use the excel file that I have given you in Module 1 in order
    to record each student’s effort to work on their worksheet ranged
    from 5 to 0. You will need to send the file to the instructor by the
    end of the semester.
