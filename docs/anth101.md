## Changes/modifications/extra information made to the Units: 

## Unit 1 – Culture 
1.	Introductions of the course and the instructor 
-	Dr Aanaya or Prof. Eileen would drop in for the first class to meet with everyone, and talk about the course and themselves.  
2.	Facilitator introduces the Learning Lab and facilitation model. 
-	To practice the facilitation model as well as let students to know each other, conducting a small activity could be a good idea to start. Gimkit/Kahoot to touch a few general Anthropology terminologies or small group discussions to break the ice are good considerations. 
3.	Locate textbooks, navigate Moodle site, and outline the course (go through the requirements and assessments, introduce writing center and learning coach, if necessary, as per the instructor). 
4.	Watch & Reflect: - Watch the video Adventures with Nacirema (Unit 1-Topic 3), then organize group discussions on: 
-	What does your cultural background share in common or difference with Nacirema? 
-	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hxusdfb3g04 
-	Divide students in different learning pods and 4-5 students in a Pod.
-	Nacirema ("American" spelled backward) is a term used in anthropology and sociology in relation to aspects of the behavior and society of citizens of the United States of America.) 
5.	Close the session with Q&A and remind students to prepare the Unit 2 Activity-Ethnography Challenge 

## Unit 2 – Fieldwork (Help students increase their observation skills and learn to be descriptive about all they see and experience.)
1.	Students to-do: Unit Test 1 (covers Units 1 and 2)
2.	Group discussions on ONE of the following questions about culture change: 
-	Ethnotourism (people travelling to visit and experience Indigenous cultures and societies) is becoming more popular. While it offers economic opportunities, it is also changing these cultures. How might a small-scale culture be affected, and how might an anthropologist work with them to adjust to changes brought about by tourism? 
-	Dishwashers are not common in Japanese homes. If you were tasked with marketing dishwashers in Japan how would conduct the research? 
-	How might the introduction of computers in a small-scale society change people’s ideas attitudes and behaviors? 
-	If you were working with an Indigenous people in rural India to improve irrigation, what questions would you ask? 
3.	Students present their photos from the Ethnography Challenge. Facilitator to prepare to give acknowledgements and encouragements since it is the first graded course activity. 
4.	Attempt to discuss the principle of “Do no harm” using Scriptural values of love, compassion, and mercy: 
-	Ephesians 4:32; Micah 6:8; Mark 12: 30-31
-	“Be kind and compassionate to one another, ..." – Ephesians 4:32
-	“He has told you, ... what is good; and what does the LORD require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness ...” – Micah 6:8
-	“ ... you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and...You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' – Mark 12: 30-31

## Unit 3 – Livelihoods 
1.	Watch & Reflect: Watch the videos Attenborough, Kalahari, and Hadza (Unit 3-Topic 1) together, then invite students to use subsistence terminology in talking about the cultural group. 
-	Attenborough https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=826HMLoiE_o 
-	Kalahari https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJiuyKLM2vo 
-	Hadza https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8q8tfzdNNA 
-	Compare the Sub-Saharan hunter-gatherer practices with Canada’s Inuit and Sto:lo First Nations subsistence practices. (Facilitator to prepare to give general background info of the aboriginal group in Canada.)
2.	Lead students to discover Ten Thousand Villages (https://www.tenthousandvillages.com/fair-trade) and the process and practice of Fair trade (Topic 2-Reading #2) and the practice of Freegan (Topic 2-Reading #3). 
3.	Introduce UnThing Experiment (reflection will be submitted at the end of Unit 5), direct students to choose challenges, then invite students to start working on it. (Facilitator to consider take the challenge along with students.)

-	Students are encouraged to share their kinship diagrams. (Students may not be prepared then facilitator to consider create an example by using Lucidchart (https://www.lucidchart.com/blog/make-a-kinship-diagram-online) to show how it could be done.) A Sample from the previous students shows below:   Credit: Cami Matsumoto ANTH101 SP22
-	A good diagram will enable other students to explain someone else’s diagram. The best practice would be asking for a volunteer (or two or three) to share their diagram, and have a classmate explain the kinship system. 
3.	To discover the structure of marriage, watch the videos (Unit 4-Topic 2) together, then invite students to discuss. 
-	Too Young to Wed https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYleXcpbzKY 
Multiple Husbands https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4yjrDSvze0 
Dowry https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e85mnwHuaoM 
-	Videos focus on age (child brides), many wives, multiple husbands, and dowry. Facilitator to pick depending on time arrangement or students’ interests. 
-	Facilitator to pay attention to leverage the conversations according to students’ outputs. E.g., The diversity of students brings various real examples of marriage forms into the topic, such as many wives and husbands. Since students are not mature enough as first-year college students, make sure that students not mocking each other and maintain a balanced learning environment.  
4.	Remind students to stay strong in their commitments to the UnThing Experiment Challenge.

## Unit 8 – Religion & Rites
1.	Description and comparison of the Maori and Aborigines (Graded) – Invite students to view the web-based videos about the Aborigine of Australia and the Maori of New Zealand:

-	Direct students to discuss these worldview videos and help students realize that not all things pertaining to beliefs are religious. For instance, there are ideological beliefs and political beliefs. There are also faith beliefs and practices that inform how we should think and see the world and all that is in it; however, they do not dictate behaviors and how life should be lived. 
2.	Invite students to present their research topic on Rites of Passage by using the illustrations they have been prepared. Provide opportunity for classmates to ask 2-3 questions (2-3 minutes). If there are no questions, that is okay. Facilitator does not want to over-extend the Q&A period as each student’s knowledge on their topic is limited, as this was not a major research project. 

## Unit 9 – Authority 
1.	Students to-do: Unit Test 4 (covers Units 8 and 9) 
2.	Watch and Reflect: 
-	Resolving Conflicts The Traditional Way https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R39RWdwCmGw

3.	Remind students to prepare the last graded course activity - The UnEssay Project and walk students through the instructions under Unit 10. 
4.	Emphasize the logistics of Culture Trait Presentations for next week. While others present, each student will: 
-	Post their ONE best fact or question. Post for each presenter. Make sure that their statement is a complete thought. 
-	Use this format: either one of these, not both.
	name of presenter + FACT: here state the fact you learned. 
	name of presenter + QUESTION: here state the fact you learned. 
-	E.g.: Andrew + FACT: cultural customs like Diwali are celebrated outside of the "home country" by the Diaspora, who maintain their culture by continuing to keep traditions and celebrate annual events like the Festival of Lights. 
-	Each student will have one post per classmate, and a total of 13 statements. 
-	Let students be aware that next class will take longer than usual since it will be formal presentations followed by Q&A.

## Course Personal Reflection:
In ANTH 101, students are expected to use course terminology, reflect an anthropological focus, and think as an anthropologist. The role of facilitator in ANTH 101 is expected to walk with instructor closely, foster students’ interests of the subject, help students to understand then achieve success through various learning activities, build a sense of community, and provide a touch of spiritual development for students. ANTH 101 is a fascinating course that contains various learning activities, and creativity could be a focus among the learning outputs for facilitator. To better assess learning results of students, facilitator may be required to provide graded observations of various learning activities from Learning Lab to the instructor.
