## Course Description

Introduction to Psychology, is intended as a broad introduction to the field of psychology. It may be seen as an answer to the questions "What is psychology?" and "What do psychologists do?" Topics considered include: thought and language, intelligence, lifespan development, personality, social processes, health, stress and coping, behavioral disorders, and therapy. Attempts will be made throughout to relate the content of psychology to students' everyday experience as well as to a Christian  worldview. Of course, to take this course it is not necessary that you be a Christian. Whatever your beliefs, you are encouraged to examine them in light of what you are learning.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:

1.	**Knowledge and Application**
 - Identify basic concepts and research findings, and give examples of psychology’s integrative themes.
 - Apply psychological principles to everyday life.
 - Describe ethical principles that guide psychologists in research and therapy.

2. **Cognitive Complexity**
 - Draw appropriate, logical, and objective conclusions about behaviour and mental processes from empirical evidence.
 - Evaluate misconceptions or erroneous behavioral claims based on evidence from psychological science.
 - Design, conduct, or evaluate basic psychological research.

3. **Spiritual Formation**
 - To explore ways to integrate and articulate a Christian perspective of psychology
 - To consider and evaluate current psychological literature through a Christian worldview
 - To strengthen your understanding of God through reflective integration of psychological phenomena with your personal spirituality

## GRADING GUIDELINES
Following is a description of the letter grading:

| **A range = Superior, exceptional, outstanding**. A+ 90-100%  A 85-89%  A- 80-84% | The assignment demonstrates critical, informed, and creative theological inquiry that reflects superior understanding of essential theological/historical concepts. This means the student demonstrates depth of insight beyond what is normally expected. Carefully nuanced reasoning and writing, free from material, structural and grammatical error are presupposed in this grade. |
|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **B range = Good.**  B+ 77-79%    B 73-76%    B- 70-72%                       | The assignment demonstrates ready command of full range of concepts and shows some critical, informed, and creative inquiry that reflects above average understanding of essential theological/historical concepts. This means the student has produced an assignment that is free from material, structural and grammatical errors.                                                    |
| **C range = Acceptable.**    C+ 67-69%  C 63-66%    C- 60-62%                | The assignment demonstrates satisfactory ability to describe overall picture and essential concepts. This means the student has completed the assignment in a manner involving no significant errors. Material may not be free from structural and grammatical errors. Nuanced reasoning is not demonstrated.                                                                           |
| **D range = Below average**.    D+ 57-59%   D 53-56%    D- 50-52%           | The assignment demonstrates reasoning that is neither carefully nuanced nor coherently presented; writing is insufficient in depth of insight and/or use of texts; presentation is not free from material error in structure, spelling and grammar. This means that the student failed to respond adequately to the assignment and its intentions.                                      |
| **F = Unsatisfactory**.     F -50%                      | In one or more of the following ways the student: 1) failed to turn in the assignment; 2) did not respond to the assignment as given; 3) submitted work so thoroughly flawed as to indicate that the student did not make a serious effort, 4) was involved in plagiarism or cheating.                                                       |

## Students with a Disability
Students with a disability who need assistance are encouraged to contact the Equity of Access Office upon admission to TWU to discuss their specific needs. All disabilities must be recently documented by an appropriately certified professional and include the educational impact of the disability along with recommended accommodations. Within the first two weeks of the semester, students must meet with their professors to agree on accommodations appropriate to each class. Students should follow the steps detailed by the Equity of Access Office outlined in the Student Life section of the University Calendar.

In this section, we will outline some key ideas to consider as you facilitate this course. See below for advice on setting up your class schedule, facilitating activities and discussions, and guiding students through Learning Labs.

***NOTE:*** In the past, this course may be offered as part of various sections with various timelines for completion. Please contact the Instructor to identify the best schedule given the unique timeline for your section.

# **Learning Labs**

Note that students will do part of their learning online, and part in a Learning Lab that you will be facilitating. This is a flipped classroom model where students engage with the content at home by reading the textbook, reading and viewing course materials on Moodle as designed by the instructor, and preparing activities and assignments for the next Learning Lab. In Learning Labs, they will engage in group discussions, assignments, and other activities in order to help them engage with the course material.

***Part 1 - Sample Welcome Message and Orientation to the Course:***

I am excited to be your facilitator for Psych 106. As the course begins, I wanted to take some time now, to walk through this course so you can develop a sense of what is ahead.

This course will be organized into 12 units. Each page of the course will provide you with the following information:

 - A general overview of the topic that will be addressed during the unit.
 - Specific learning outcomes and topics for the unit.
 - Resources that you will need to address learning activities and assessments in the unit.
 - Specific learning activities that you will need to complete each unit at home (before attending your Learning Lab).
 - Information about formal assessments throughout the course.

For those who are new to using Moodle as the platform for your course content and for submitting assignments, you can find information on how to navigate through this course on the tab provided [**HERE**](https://learn.twu.ca/course/view.php?id=7008&section=1).

Over the duration of the course, we will be meeting together for ___ hours per week. During our time together, I will be facilitating group discussions, answering questions, helping you with your assignments, and evaluating your participation in class using the rubric provided on each unit page.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask. I am here to help and be your guide on this journey through your Introduction to Psychology 106 course.

***Part 2: Introductions and ICE Breakers***

**NOTE:** *I included this as an option for Facilitators. Depending on the nature of the student’s, or your own personal preferences/experiences, please feel free to use or discard. I would, however, strongly recommend an “introductory activity” or some sort as much of the Learning Lab’s will involve discussion with one another. This is just one sample of what you could use:*

Before we get started today, lets all introduce ourselves and get to know each other. I would like everyone to share a little about who you are and why you are taking this course. If you already know most of your classmates, be sure to include some new information they might not all know about you such as:

 - General information about yourself as a person and a student.
 - What field you intend to “go into” when you graduate.
 - Your biggest question, doubt, or fear about the class.
 - How did you come to enroll in this course or program?
 - Do you have any experience with this topic?
 - What do you hope to gain from this class?

Student’s can then share this information with the class – either their own or have partners share about their partners.

!!! **NOTE:** Please remind students to keep language and “tone” professional and respectful. This might be a good opportunity to “frame” the expectations for the rest of Learning Lab discussions as some topics may be divisive or controversial – student’s need to be made aware that everyone needs to focus on respectful dialogue.

# **General Expectations**

Prior to beginning each unit, it is strongly recommended that you take a moment to familiarize yourself with the content, and activities, student’s will be participating in. While your primary role will be in facilitating discussion during Learning Lab’s, you will also need to help “troubleshoot” any issues or general questions that arise throughout each unit. Specific notes for each unit will be provided in subsequent sections of this guide.  If any questions arise, please connect with the Instructor ASAP.

**General Overview**

As mentioned in the previous section, take some time, prior to each Learning Lab, to familiarize yourself with the content and guiding questions of that given unit. Learning Lab’s have, intentionally, been left “open” so that student’s can explore and pursue their interests in the content of each unit - It is not the intention to keep these labs as rigid structures! As you will see in each unit, guiding questions have been provided for student’s to ponder and “engage” with.

Please also direct students to the quizzes at the end of each unit. One of the Learning Outcomes in this course is for student’s to develop some familiarity with key terminology in the field of psychology – these quizzes are intended to support that. Also reiterate with the students that they are not part of a formal assessment – they are for practice to prepare for assignments and formal quizzes and tests. You will also see that some chapters from the textbook span two units in this course – as such, not every unit will have a quiz. Please make students aware of this.

# **Learning Lab Activities**

As you will experience, different groups of student’s bring different opportunities and different challenges. If you develop the sense that  a particular group is willing and able to engage in group dialogue, it may be best to structure conversations so that everyone is contributing and responding to one another. It might also be helpful to structure smaller pairings so dialogue can take place in a more comfortable “intimate” setting before bringing all students together to share their thoughts and ideas.

# Introduction

In other settings, student’s may be more reluctant to engage in group dialogue. As such, your role will involve offering some latitude around what participation looks like. Following-up with prompts such as “why,” or “can you explain or give some examples” is encouraged, this does not always result in for fruitful dialogue. As you will see, the questions are quite “wide” in scope and ask student’s to call upon their own experiences and/or beliefs – due to this nature, some of the following might be options for student’s as well:

 - Drawing a picture
 - Designing a game
 - Creating a skit
 - Developing an app
 - Writing a poem (or song lyrics)
 - Listing words (in English or their first language) that are connected to the question(s).
 - Creating a math formula or using numbers to represent their thoughts.
 - Design an experiment to test their ideas.
 - Anything else that they might be comfortable with in demonstrating their thoughts.

As the facilitator, it is trusted that you will use your own experience, training, and best judgement with respect to which direction you take the Learning Lab’s in. If you are struggling, please always refer to the guiding principle here: it is intended that student’s engage with the course content in a meaningful way and be active participants in their own learning, as well as supporting the learning of their peers. While I understand that this flexibility, at times, can be overwhelming, please do not hesitate to connect with me so we can clarify and discuss.

Ultimately, student’s will be assessed on their openness and willingness to actively participate in a meaningful way – please remind them of this at the start of each Learning Lab as it might serve as a motivator moving forward....


## Lesson Notes for PSYCH 106

The following pages provide key information for the PSYCH 106 unit modules (schedules, activity instructions, lab suggestions, key learnings, etc.). Please see the full course notes on Moodle.

# Learning Labs - Ideas and Suggestions

As mentioned in previous notes, the intent of Learning Labs is to focus on stimulating thought and dialogue. Much of the *"questions"* in this course are open to interpretation - there is no "right" answer. The study of psychology also requires some open-mindedness, compassion, and understanding of the complexities of our relationship with the world around us. Student's have much to learn from one another's thoughts and ideas and, ultimately, that is the hope and intention of our Learning Lab's and the questions that have been provided to guide thought and reflection.

These guiding questions have been left intentionally "open" as I want to encourage student's to explore these areas and, hopefully, stimulate some thought and excitement for the field of psychology. This, however, can be a challenging process if student's are reluctant to participate. Between your skill-set as a facilitator, and my experience as an instructor, it is my hope we can work together to create a positive, engaged atmosphere during Learning Labs to promote personal growth.

Below are some ideas - if you are comfortable, however, please feel free to incorporate your own ideas to encourage learning and growth:

1. [**1-2-4-ALL**](http://www.liberatingstructures.com/1-1-2-4-all/)

This activity helps to:

 - Engage every individual in searching for answers.
 - Avoid overhelping and the overcontrol-dependency vicious cycle.
 - Create safe spaces for expression, diminish power differentials.
 - Express “silent” conversations and expand diversity of inputs.
 - Enrich quality of observations and insights before expression.
 - Build naturally toward consensus or shared understanding.

2. [**Impromptu Networking**](http://www.liberatingstructures.com/2-impromptu-networking/)

This activity is good for:

 - Initiate participation immediately for everyone provided the questions are engaging.
 - Attract deeper engagement around challenges.
 - Invite stories to deepen as they are repeated.
 - Help shy people warm up.
 - Affirm individual contributions to solutions.
 - Emphasize the power of loose and new connections.
 - Suggest that little things can make a big difference.

3. [**User Experience Fishbowl**](http://www.liberatingstructures.com/18-users-experience-fishbowl/)

This activity helps:

 - Get down-to-earth field experience and all the questions and answers about new endeavors out on the table for everyone to understand at the same time.
 - Create conditions for new ideas to emerge.
 - Make space for every participant’s imagination and experience to show up.
 - Build skills in listening, storytelling, pattern-finding, questioning, and observing.
 - Celebrate early adopters and innovators who have gained field experience (often failing forward and vetting the prototype).

4. [**Drawing Together**](http://www.liberatingstructures.com/20-drawing-together/)

This activity helps to:

 - Reveal insight or understanding not accessible with verbal or linear methods.
 - Tap all the sources of knowledge for innovation (explicit, tacit, latent/emergent).
 - Signal that a quest or journey in search of new discoveries is under way.
 - Develop and deepen shared understanding of a vision or complex dynamics.
 - Create closer connections among group members.

!!! *Note: This is a good activity to consider if student's are particularly reluctant to engage in discussion*

! ***The following sections will outline the guiding questions for each unit in the course. As you read through, consider which activity(s) you might consider to facilitate conversation. If you are struggling, please contact the instructor for additional guidance.

### Suggested Time for Different Online or In Class Lab Activities

As a facilitator, you may need to lead your students in face-to-face interactions, whether online or in a classroom, for up to 2 hours or more. Fortunately, there are numerous questions posed through each of the Units and many ways to address those questions. Below are some suggested timelines for the various activities you can do to enhance student interaction and learning. At the same time, please use your discretion to avoid unnecessarily ending an activity that is going well, or prolonging an activity that requires changing. The activities can be conducted as individual or group exercises. (Please note that “question(s)” is used to allow the opportunity to bundle two or more questions together, when appropriate.)

Drawing a picture – 15 to 30 minutes of drawing, 5 to 10 minutes of discussion per person as to how the drawing relates to the question(s)

Designing a game – 15 to 30 minutes of designing, up to 30 minutes of playing the game (this is dependent upon how many games are made and how many people are in the class)

Developing an interpretive dance – 15 minutes to develop a dance, 5 minutes of performance per person/group, and 5 minutes per person/group to share about how the dance relates to the question(s)

Creating a skit – 30 minutes to create a skit (skits can be funny, however, be sure to keep them respectful and informative – avoid ridicule and discrimination), 5 to 10 minutes to act out the skit, 15 minutes to discuss what it was like to make and act out a skit and what it taught them about the question(s)

Making an app – 15 to 30 minutes of development, 5 to 10 minutes of discussion per person as to how the app addresses the question(s)

Writing some song lyrics or a poem – 15 minutes to write song/poem, 5 minutes of performance per person, and 5 minutes per person to share about how the song/poem relates to the question(s)

Listing words (in English or your first language) that are connected to the question(s) – 10 minutes to write a list of words and 5 minutes to share how those words relate to the question(s)

Making sounds or music – 10 to 15 minutes to compose sounds/music, 5 minutes to perform, and 5 minutes to share how those sounds/music relate to the question(s)

Creating a math formula or use numbers to represent your thoughts – 10 to 15 minutes to formulate and 5 minutes to link the numbers/formula to the question(s)

Design an experiment to test your ideas – 15 to 30 minutes to design an experiment, 5 to 10 minutes to discuss the experiment and how it addresses the question(s)

Discussion – Up to 1 hour of uninterrupted discussion for online/Zoom style interactions (though it may need to be adjusted to 15 to 30-minute blocks of time), in a classroom, it could be for the totality of the meeting time  

## Unit 1: Thought and Language

***Topic 1***

Topic 1 will review important considerations when conducting research. Student's will then complete a quiz on important terminology.

---

***Topic 2***

This section focuses on problem-solving...in that context, student's are asked to respond to the following scenario/prompt:

In the largest sense, society is breaking into two classes:

*The first class are people who know how to think. These people realize that most problems are open to examination and creative solution. If a problem appears in the lives of these people, their intellectual training will quickly lead them to a solution or an alternative statement of the problem. These people are the source of the most important product in today's economy – ideas.*

*The second class, the vast majority of society, are people who cannot think for themselves. I call these people ‘idea consumers’ – metaphorically speaking, they wander around in a gigantic open-air mall of facts and ideas. The content of their experience is provided by television, the Internet and other shallow data pools. These people believe collecting images and facts makes them educated and competent, and all their experiences reinforce this belief. The central, organizing principle of this class is that ideas come from somewhere else, from magical persons, geniuses, ‘them.’*

Consider the following prompts to help better prepare for the discussion:

 - Do you agree or disagree with this claim?

 - Do you know people that fit in the second category? What causes this difference? How might it be changed?

---

***Topic 3***

This Topic discussed bias - in that context, students are asked to consider the following question:

 - Give an example from your own experience of one of the cognitive biases, discussed here or in the textbook, that you have fallen prey to.

---

***Topic 4***

This topic shifted focus to the importance of language - in this case, the language in the Bible:

 - Give some examples of the importance of language in the Bible or other religious writings.

----

***Topic 5***

Considering everything student's have learned in this unit, they are asked to consider:

 - How important for our understanding of who we are as humans is the distinctiveness of our language ability? Is it a sign of the image of God?***

## Unit 2: Intelligence Testing

***Topic 1***

Topic 1 will introduce intelligence (what it is). In addition, student's will also explore different types of intelligence. The Learning Activity will provide student's with the opportunity complete their own intelligence tests and reflect on the outcome. In addition, student's are also asked to consider:

- How do you feel about the EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE TESTS? Did you learn anything? If so, what were the important areas that were illumined by the test?
- Is ‘emotional intelligence’ a valid concept worth measuring?
- Do you believe E-IQ is more important than "intelligence" as measured by IQ scores for success and happiness in your life?”

---

***Topic 2***

This section focuses on IQ Testing. Student's will be given the opportunity to take some IQ Tests and, once again, consider the "meaning" of the outcomes. In addition, student's are asked to consider the following:

The Bible says, in James; Chapter 2:

*My brothers, as believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ, don't show favoritism. Suppose a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and fine clothes, and a poor man in shabby clothes also comes in. If you show special attention to the man wearing fine clothes and say, "Here's a good seat for you," but say to the poor man, "You stand there" or "Sit on the floor by my feet," have you not discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?*

- Could we be guilty of favoritism in esteeming more intelligent people above less intelligent people? In society? In Church?

---

***Topic 3***

Finally, Topic 3 explores the idea of Nature-Nature and IQ - specifically, the challenge around test biases.

After exploring the content, student's will be provided with a short quiz to test their own understanding of some important terms. Please remind student's that this quiz is NOT GRADED.

Student's will also be asked to consider the following (and discuss the questions below):

*If you suggest that Asians have darker skin than Caucasians, you are not considered racist; this is an obvious fact with a genetic basis. However, if you suggest that Asians are more intelligent than Caucasians (as IQ tests show), or that African Americans are less intelligent, watch out!*

- What is different about these two claims that makes us accept one and not the other? Is it the role of nature versus nurture? Or is it more closely tied to the high value our culture places on intelligence, and especially IQ scores?

- If IQ were unimportant would it matter if one racial or gender group tended to score higher than another group? Would you be considered racist or sexist for suggesting this?

## Unit 3: The Developing Person - Part 1

This is the first part of a two part section of the course. In this first part, we look at important developmental considerations in the field of psychology....

***Topic 1***

This Topic begins looking at the idea of Designer babies. Please refer to this this topic (specifically). For this guiding question, it refers to a pamphlet found in the Learning Activities section of Topic 1 - students are then asked for their thoughts.

!! *Please bare in mind that some might consider this a controversial subject - remind students of the expectations for Learning Labs and that the focus is on open-mindedness and respectful dialogue.*

---

***Topic 2***

This Topic focuses on "children" as a developmental stage:

 - What is God like for children of different levels of cognitive development? If you can, give some examples from children you know....

 -  Would children even have an idea of God if they were not taught it?

---

***Topic 3***

Although this Topic discusses adolescence, student's are asked to reflect on that period of time in their own life:


 - Would you want to live your adolescence over again if you could? Why or why not?

---

!!! *Please remind student's that the next unit (Unit 4), also includes some major assignments - their first quiz and their first writing assignment. Please suggest that student's turn their attention to these assignments and begin thinking about preparing.*

## Unit 4: The Developing Person - Part 2

This is the second part that continues to build upon Unit 3. Many of the questions will be similiar but focus on later developmental stages.

***Topic 1***

This Topic addresses Adulthood. As many student's are either approaching this, at this, or potentially past this - it should be an interesting conversation that everyone can contribute to:

 - What do you hope to accomplish during your “adult development” years?***
  - *(If you are past these years, what are you most pleased with?)*

---

***Topic 2***

This final Topic brings up the idea of aging and death. Depending on where this course is being offered, please be aware that there are many cultural complexities to this particular topic. It might be a good idea to invite students to respond to these questions while providing some insight/context of their own culture:

 - How do react to the thought of your inevitable death?
 - Do your religious beliefs make a difference?
 - Is death ever easy? What concerns do you have about your death? Pain? Those left behind? The unknown? Unfinished business?

---

! *Student's are also responsible for completing a quiz and a writing assignment following Unit 4. Please remind student's of this. If they have any questions, have them contact the instructor ASAP.*

## Unit 5: Personality

In this unit, student's will begin to explore understanding *how we become who we are....* It is hoped, that the guiding questions in each Learning Lab are particularly interesting and lead to in-depth discussion as many of the questions ask student's to reflect on who they are.

***Topic 1***

 - Does God speak through dreams?
 - What reasons do you have for your opinion? Can you give an example?

---

***Topic 2***

 - If you wanted to study the psychologically healthiest individuals, whom would you study? How would you decide?

---

***Topic 3***

Part of this unit's Learning Lab will have student's take a personality test - it is hoped this stimulates some thought and reflection. In that context, student's are asked to respond to the following:

 - What is the role of heredity in personality?
 - Is our personality inherited and set for life? Can it be modified?

Author Tim LaHaye has taken the Greek idea of types and body humors and adapted it to a Christian perspective incorporating the concept of spiritual gifts.

 - Does the bible support an approach to personality that links individual differences to inherited traits?
 - What is the role of the Holy Spirit in relationship to traits? Are these different “gifts” (I Cor. 12)? Different “fruit (Gal 5:22)? Can they be changed?

---

***Topic 4***

Research indicates that an internal locus of control is associated with more positive psychological outcomes than an external locus of control:

 - Does this mean that Christians (and others who believe in God) are less psychologically healthy because they believe an external force (God) is in control?

## Unit 6: Social Pyschology - Part 1

Unit 6 & 7 are another two-part section from the textbook.

***Topic 1***

 - Describe a time when you were forced to act in a certain way, and then later found you had come to enjoy what you were doing. That is, your attitude followed your actions.
 - Could this happen with religious attitudes and beliefs too?

---

***Topic 2***

 - What pressures for conformity exist in your community? On your campus?***
 - What happens to people who do not conform?
 - Is conformity good or bad? What would society be like without conformity?

---

***Topic 3***

Consider the following scenario/prompt:

*When people read about Stanley Milgram's experiments on obedience to au­thor­ity, they are often puzzled at the ethics of this research. You have probably have heard of these studies before and already have some views about the ap­propriate­ness of the procedures. All psychologists follow ethical guidelines in their research established by national governing bodies (e.g., CPA, APA). At the heart of these state­ments about ethics are the responsibilities to: protect the subject's welfare, avoid deception, provide anonymity, and provide therapy or relief from any unin­tended results of the experiment. Each of these general principles applies to the Milgram studies. Do you believe that the studies could be conducted today, given what we know now about ethics and about Milgram's results?*

 - Does the severity of the problem studied—in this case destructive obedience—justify more extreme steps to manipulate and deceive experimental subjects?

 - Under what circumstances do you personally think that deceiving subjects in a scientific experiment might be ethically warranted or justified?

---

***Topic 4***

 - Have you ever been taught a sales technique in your job experience? If so, explain...

If you have not been taught a sales technique, you certainly have experienced many as a consumer. Can you give an example? Here is one:

*One of the standard ways that door-to-door salespersons will try to get you to buy something is the so-called foot-in-the-door technique: They will ask you to do them a small favor. Having done so, you will have to justify your own behavior to yourself by think­ing nice things about the seller. Hence, you are more likely to comply when they ask you to sign on the dotted line.*
