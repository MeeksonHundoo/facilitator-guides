<u>Facilitator Background Information</u>

The FNDN 102 course is an evidenced based, salutogenic, embodied course in personal health, happiness and meaning. The focus is on activities, perspectives and environments that promote human flourishing. Let me try to explain these terms of reference:

***Evidenced based***- In the field of wellness and flourishing there are many popular and unverified strategies to achieving wellbeing, however in this course we will primarily utilize the empirical method of finding truth. Scholarly and empirical sources will be the foundation for each topic covered in the course.

***Salutogenic***- The concept of wellbeing contains both positive life strategies and risk avoidance strategies. Because of our limitations of time we focus primarily on the positive life strategies and don’t cover the pathogenic side of wellbeing.

***Embodied***- The FNDN 102 course will focus on the **lived experience** of flourishing as opposed to the thought experiment of wellbeing. The default of the course is for personal and practical applications of the wellbeing concepts from an embodied cognition perspective. The majority of the time students spend in the course should be them “doing” and “experiencing”. This embodiment is represented in the; Personal Application assignments, Review and Integration assignments, Flourishing Proposal, Leisure/Sleep Tracker, and Final Portfolio assignments.

***Personal-*** Using a structure or building analogy for wellbeing, the FNDN 102 course is designed to provide the primary building blocks for flourishing, however, the shape of the building and the ratio of building blocks will vary for each student. The course has a distinct focus on the choice of how each wellbeing strategy gets implemented in a student’s life. The primary task of this course is for the student to assemble their own structure of wellbeing that is effective and resilient in their current environment.

***Sources of information***: The three primary academic disciplines that we combine in FNDN 102 are: physical health, positive psychology, theology/philosophy. Each of these domains has different approaches, ways of knowing, perspectives and practices of wellbeing.

# **Assignments**

The assignments in FNDN 102 are designed to engage students in the lived experience of wellbeing and are the most critical piece of pedagogy for content delivery. In essence the course content should almost always culminate in student work.

***Personal Application Assignments (PAA)***: These six assignments are designed for the student to experience practices of wellbeing from the three academic discipline. They form the back bone of the course. We have chosen one common practice in each domain and one choice practice from each. The pedagogical concept is Kolb’s model of experiential learning:

1.  Concrete experience- the practice

2.  Reflective observation- personal reflection

3.  Abstract conceptualization- reflection and debrief with other students

4.  Active experimentation- retry practice (this will only happen with the one PAA practice in the flourishing plan, however you will see this show up in other assignments in the course.)

***Personal Flourishing Proposal***: This is the next step in scaffolding the PAAs into a more focused four-week practice. The three important elements in this assignment are: first the practice routines which will aid in compliance and resilience. Second, the evidenced based empirical support for the practice. Lastly, a tracking sheet that reflects the scope of the practice and should include episodic personal evaluations (a comments section for at minimum each week). It's important to remind students this flourishing proposal is then scaffolded even further into the Final Portfolio.

***Leisure Time & Sleep Tracker:*** The primary goal of this assignment is to have the students understand how their leisure and sleep time contribute to their personal wellbeing. This assignment is very similar in its objective to the PAA’s, consequently follows Kolb’s model for learning. The debriefing with other students is a critical component in the abstract conceptualization stage of experiential learning and designed to occur in the learning labs.

**Review and Integration Assignments (R&I)**: These assignments are designed to help students engage and reflect on specific topics inside the units. Sometimes they are scaffolded into larger assignments (E.g., the behavior change and leisure category assignments, or even into the Final Portfolio: wellbeing definition and spiritual definitions). When they do scaffold into other assignments it is helpful to make students aware of this ahead of time. Again, we have a policy of no late R&I assignments because often they are multi-stage in nature (E.g., the wellbeing definitions leading to the definition forums for peer interaction).

***Movie “Silence” Reflection***: This movie was chosen for three reasons: its high cinematic quality, its portrayal of spirituality and suffering, and its post formal thought construction (I.e., it asks questions that allow for many different answers). This assignment tries to get beyond the primary question “Could I die for my faith?” into some of the more nuanced portrayals of spirituality and suffering. It is important in this assignment to have students cite various scenes in the movie when reflecting and drawing conclusions from the movie. Also, this movie is to work in conjunction with our text book *Man’s Search for Meaning*. It is important to have discussions and reflections around the similarities and differences between the two resources.

***Final Portfolio:*** This is the summative assignment that draws together most of the other assignments in this course. We encourage students to integrate and reflect on their past assignments for the Final Portfolio. They may need to tweak them to answer the specific questions in each part however often the first draft of each component is already completed. The other items to remind them of is to use the course resources to answer the specific questions with proper citations and reference lists. The last issue, is again to make the answers in the Final Portfolio personal. The Final Portfolio should be their attempt to articulate their structure of wellbeing, describing the specific composition and shape of the flourishing architecture.

# **Lesson Notes for FNDN 102** 

The following pages provide key information for individual units in the course (activities, transitions, instructions, etc). Anything not discussed here is explicitly written in Moodle so please review the full course in Moodle.

We have tried to provide a relatively consistent unit format to allow the students to become familiar with the general structure and flow of the course. Each unit generally consists of two topic areas each with resource material (video or reading material), combined with a review and integration assignment. In the first half of the course each unit will have a PAA and in the last half students will complete some of the larger assignments. Because the Final Portfolio is integrally scaffolded into the assignments for the course, we strongly encourage students to read through the Final Portfolio instructions early in the course to see what is expected of them in the end.

**<u>Unit Lessons (Blue is background, Red is Zoom meeting agendas)</u>**

# **Unit 1: The Beginning** 

#### **Three items to be concerned with in this unit:**

1.  Help students navigate through the different programs. Often these will be freshman students who have never taken an online course before. Important to remind them to systematically travel through each item under each topic going from top to bottom. Highlight how each unit will contain the following structure

    1.  Two topics- with video or articles

    2.  Review and Integration assignments – no lates accepted

    3.  PAA (week long practices) in the first six weeks and then other assignments after that. Lates are accepted with a 10% per day penalty up to 50%

2.  One of the implicit goals of this unit is to begin to create a “Community of Learners”. Because online education can be a very individual experience, we want to counteract this with activities and experiences that create a sense of a shared journey with much of the learning coming from peer interaction.

3.  Students start the course with the end in mind. Several of the assignments in this unit are directly related to the Final Portfolio in the course. Remind them to review the entire Final Portfolio during this first week of the course.

#### **Topic 1. How to live the Good Life** 

#### **Picture of Wellbeing –** post a picture that illustrates what "wellbeing" means to you. Add a 25 word explanation. Students should be encouraged to look at other peoples pictures

Students should be encouraged to review the two videos (encourage students to play all instructional videos at 1.2x speed if it doesn’t already play at that speed) and two articles in this topic

#### **Review and Integration \#1.1 Write a definition and critique of two classmates – two steps**

1.  Wellbeing Definition – Post 100 word definition to the forum. Remind them this wellbeing definition is going to be in the Final Portfolio, in a way they have already started their final exam in the course. Post Encourage them to cite the two articles in their conceptual definition. They don’t have to agree with the articles but can draw out parts they agree or disagree with

2.  Critique two classmates - Encourage students to read through how other students have critiqued their definitions and make changes for the Final Portfolio version.

#### **Topic 2. What is Happiness** 

#### Flourishing is a concept that exists at the nexus of happiness and meaning. It is important for students to understand the science of happiness is not antithetical to their religious beliefs and often is complementary (E.g., gratitude). 

#### **Assessment**

#### Wellbeing Survey

#### This survey is an overview of the FNDN 102 course and consequently can be good for a personal pre and post perspective on students’ wellbeing worldview. Remind them the Satisfaction with Life survey will be completed again at the end of the course and both pre and post scores will go into the Final Portfolio**.** Place completed survey in the drop box 

# **Personal Application Assignment (PAA): Gratitude practice** 

Each PAA will come with an assignment document and an explainer video. This first PAA is from positive psychology and has two options

1.  Gratitude journal

2.  Letter of appreciation

Its important to remind them this first week long practice will be due next week and they only need to complete one of the two options. Remind them that grading rubric is on the last page of each PAA

Learning Lab: Course format introduction

#### **First Week Zoom session- first week**

(Jack) Welcome to FNDN 102GX – Human flourishing which is an embodied (practical) course about Health Happiness and Meaning. Main goal of todays Zoom session is for introductions to us and each other. Introduce the course on Moodle and also Unit \#1 and what is due this week.

Students introduce themselves and what time zone they are from (Emebet do this any way your want)

Instructor Intros:

1.  Mine – already on the Moodle site. So won’t go through it all again however I have taught at TWU for 35 years and on line for many years. My (Jacks)definition to wellbeing

“to become a person who benefits those around me, maximize pleasure and minimize pain, and is growing into my humanity”

- picture of my wellbeing.

2.  Course facilitator – personal story and definition to wellbeing and picture of wellbeing

3.  Break our rooms-

    1.  Introduce yourself

    2.  Where is home

    3.  Family – number of siblings

    4.  What is your best COVID copping strategy

    5.  How do you know if you are flourishing and what does that look like for you (physically, emotionally or spiritually?)Show picture of wellbing from course (10 mins)

\* you will learn much from your peers in this course because Emebet and I are at a very different stage of life and it is your peers that are at the same place as you in the journey of wellbeing

1.  (Jack ) Welcome to FNDN 102 "Our goal is to equip students with scientifically validated strategies for living a fulfilling life, This course has three perspectives that we designed it around

    1.  Embodied cognition – or the science of experience – “how do you snowboard” – you will never know until you experience it

    2.  The Integrated self – you cannot separate the physical from the emotional or cognitive or social or spiritual – this body is your brain- 9 sensory nerves feeding the brain information for every one motor nerve

    3.  This course is about the Human Project – your life project is to grow into your humanity

> The Human project
>
> This is Not a human potential course about life hacks to maximize human potential
>
> We take the perspective that we are born Human Beings but we grow into our Humanity. Thru being intentional, thru effort, learning (which includes failure), positively adapting and growth. My personal flourishing project is to cultivate my potential for being human thru self care, compassion, meaningful work that contributes to building my humanity and a better society, with an emphasis on human dignity, both my own and others. This course is about “Work, Love, Play and Service to Others” because these environments can significantly contribute to my humanity. Growth is a significant part of human flourishing and is best learned under conditions of suffering (there are things I will only learn from picking up something heavy( effort) or from personal failure, pain or tragedy. Its in our adversity that we can experience our greatest humanity. The good news is “to be human is to suffer” some of you have suffered greatly and some of you not as much but no one here has not known personal pain, suffering, loss and failure. To learn from this suffering we must be intentional with it and not try to deny or distract ourselves from it, we must “be” with our suffering. It will not last forever but it will leave its mark on us. Human Flourishing is about how we use lifes experiences to mold and shape our humanity.

Human Flourishing means human action in the environment and human response to the environment which if constructed positively results in wellbeing ( intentionality and action are always required for my thriving)

One of the primary goals of this course is you experiencing wellbeing, you physically interacting with your environment and creating patterns of behavior that result in your flourishing. These patterns of behavior become “rituals of wellbeing”

Course Format (Course facilitator)

> We are obviously doing this entire course online and primarily asynchronously. You may not have much previous experience with online course but it is our commitment to help you be successful in this course. And one of the ways we operationalize that is we will respond to any email within 24 hrs on week days. This course is still relatively new to the Global part of TWU and we have significantly altered the format from the original version, so be patient with us as we are trying something new. Please feel free to contact us if something doesn’t line up, like due dates or technology doesn’t work, links that don’t work and we will try to correct those as quickly as possible. That actually helps us if you find the glitches. The asynchronous part allows you to work ahead if you want, as hopefully you have noticed the entire course is now open and available.

\* highly recommend going through the Final Portfolio(which is the final exam in the course) in Unit 12. This will give you a perspective on where we are going and you will see specific assignments throughout the course that directly tie into the final portfolio. You will notice two parts of unit 1 are directly in the final portfolio. My objective for the course assignments is once you have completed them all you have the majority of what you need for the final portfolio in the co

# **Unit 2: The Integrative Self** 

The focus of this unit is on the interconnectedness of our lived experience of wellbeing. To this end we have chosen two very divergent topics however highlight to the students where they overlap or impact each other (E.g., moral reasons for nutritional choices). The two topics in this unit are ones some students will feel very passionately about, its important to allow them to express this passion and allow for further engagement (enrichment resources) if the student is interested.

#### **Topic 1. Nutrition** 

The analogy I’m using in this section is a journey and the goal of this unit is to have the student to articulate what is the next step for them on this journey. Students come to this topic with vast experience because we feed ourselves multiple times a day. With that in mind we start with a nutrition survey (REAPS questionnaire) that checks for how much they know about nutrition.

Nutrition Survey: complete the REAPS questionnaire for general knowledge of nutrition.

Nutritional Journey: is a series of five videos that covers some of the broad topics in nutrition.

1.  Why we eat

2.  The science of nutrition

3.  Biological nutrient requirements

4.  Health eating patterns

5.  The morality of eating

#### 

#### Review and Integration \#2.1 Nutritional Journey 

#### Let students know the quiz format is used for efficiency because it allow students to quickly answer a few questions without creating a new document with a dropbox. 

#### 

#### **Topic 2. Spirituality** 

Spirituality is one of the threads we want to weave through the entire course because it is so central to our core objectives at TWU. While TWU is a Christian university and we orient our discussion of spirituality around Christianity, its important to communicate that we honor and respect a wide variety of forms of spirituality. Because this is a personal course in human flourishing the goal is for the students to pursue their chosen path of spirituality and they will not be penalized for articulating these various perspectives.

Defining Spirituality: write a personal definition for spirituality and religion. Then what are the differences between the two. This is in a quiz format for ease of review

Watch the two videos and read through the power point on History of Spirituality

# *Review and Integration \#2.1 Spirituality* 

Read through the word document that outlines what to write about in response to the above videos. Remind them this assignment will also scaffold into the Final Portfolio.

*Learning Lab: discussion on nutrition and spirituality*

1.  Student questions about Nutrition

2.  Student questions about Spirituality

3.  Exploring the integration of nutrition and spirituality

4.  Explaining the Nutrition PAA for this week

**Personal Application Assignment (PAA): Nutrition**

This PAA is the first from the physical domain and has two options:

1.  Nutrition Practice – change one eating pattern and track it for one week

2.  Nutrition Assessment- track your nutritional intake for 3 days

In this PAA we need to be very sensitive to students who have trauma around food. I recommend if a student does not want to complete this PAA find an alternative with the student. Allow the student to guide the instructor as to what they feel comfortable doing and if they don’t know what to do I recommend one of the choices in the other physical PAA domain (E.g., cardio, muscle training, yoga, or flexibility practice).

**Learning lab for Unit 2**

**Second Week Zoom session – (unit \#2)**

1.  Course announcements

    1.  Can students see all the unit \#1 videos - particularly Science of Happiness video

2.  Unit \#1 review

    1.  Wellbeing survey (remember two part assignments, there was a video post as part of that assignment

    2.  Definition to wellbeing- Break out rooms

        1.  Read your Wellbeing definition and if you didn’t write one make one up and share it with the group.

        2.  Where are there similarities and differences

    3.  Critique- final portfolio

        1.  Relate your personal definition to wellbeing articles

            1.  Eg Maximize Pleasure and minimize pain, desire fulfillment theories

        2.  Define terms “Healthy” is often a term that comes up but what does that mean, do I have to be an athlete or be high performing?

        3.  Dualistic thinking - Mind body divide vs the lived experience of wellbeing

            1.  Eg breaking into physical and emotional and spiritual is not how we experience wellbeing, I’m a holistic person ( My story of losing vision and making money)

    4.  PAA Gratitude – break out rooms

        1.  What did you do and why

        2.  What was the impact

    5.  Critique – good work, on the reflection part go into more detail, those who didn’t do as well didn’t share more info particularly emotional and spiritual impact.

3.  Unit \#2 – the integrative self- Nutrition and spirituality

    1.  Nutrition – what is the next step in your nutrition journey?

        1.  Q- What foods are important to you- Pleasure and Meaning ( Emebet)

    2.  Spirituality – what are the assumptions and perspectives you look at this area with

        1.  Strongly recommend you write out your definition as this is Part 2 of the final portfolio

    3.  No Review and Integration assignment this week

    4.  PAA is Nutrition for this week (two options)

        1.  3 day nutrition assessment using the nutritional analysis site Cronometer.

            1.  Print off 2 pages for each day (see video and assignment document for details

        2.  Change one nutrition practice and log that change for one week.

            1.  Be very specific about the behavior you want to change, not general “I want to eat better” eg I will consume more 7 fruit and vegetables servings per day

\*\* Remind them the Gratitude PAA is due this week

# **Unit 3: The Inner Life** 

We mentioned in the last unit we want to draw the thread of spirituality through the entire course. The spiritual life has two important components, one the contemplative life and second, a life of meaning and purpose.

#### **Topic 1. Man’s Search for Meaning** 

We see the concept of personal meaning as an integral component of spirituality. Frankl’s text is a critical course component we will return to it many times in the course.

*Read the first part of Mans Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl.*

I recommend students highlight or underline passages that resonate with them as they read it. Have them read only the first section of the text (approximately 100 pgs). See the syllabus for how to get the Mans Search for Meaning text.

#### 

#### Review and Integration Quiz \#3.1 -Frankl Quotes 

List two quotes and explain significance. If they highlight or underline when they read it this makes the R&I assignment much easier. This is in a quiz format for ease of review

*Watch two YouTube clips of Viktor Frankl*

#### **Topic 2. Mindfulness** 

Many students will have almost no experience with mindfulness or meditation. Yet this is often a fundamental skill to a contemplative life. Lao Tzo a 6<sup>th</sup> century Taoist philosopher“ To the mind that is still the whole universe surrenders” If you can introduce this contemplative practice like any physical or mental skill. The learning curve is fairly flat at first with very little benefits however if the novice can focus on practical applications (E.g., eating mindfully) they can often see the downstream effects of a more meditative practice. See lab for practical applications

*Mindfulness quiz - from University of Berkley*

*Watch the Mindfulness presentation –* with the following questions in mind

- What mindfulness is

- What you can do to be mindful

- What increasing your mindfulness can do to help you live the good life

*Learning Lab: Meaning and Mindfulness*

We will discuss Mans Search for Meaning and the quotes from the text. Also we will talk about mindfulness and mediation and what your experience with these practices.

**Personal Application Assignment (PAA):**

This PAA is the first from the contemplative domain and has multiple options and so important for the students to read through the assignment document and explainer video. For those novices I encourage them to find practical (every day) applications and for those who have practiced this before to try the meditative practices

Learning lab – Unit \#3

**<u>Unit 3 The Inner life</u>**

Many of you come from cultures and that accepts and honors the inner life. Sad to say Western culture does not pay much attention to this aspect of being human. The inner self is about what can't be seen: feelings, intuition, values, beliefs, personality, thoughts, emotions, fantasies, spirituality, desire, and purpose. A strong inner self means that you can self-regulate, are self-aware, have clarity, experience joy or beauty and a strong sense of value and purpose life. This unit will focus on our inner world with the belief that our wellbeing is closely connected to this inner life.

1.  Topic \#1 Read the fist portion (about 100 pages) of our text book **Mans Search for Meaning** which is about Victor Frankl’s time in the concentration camp. Has everyone got the access to the text book. Keep notes with what resonates with you

2.  Topic \#2 Mindfulness - go through the presentation which includes a short quiz

3.  Two Review and Integration assignments for this week – due Oct 8

    1.  Quiz two quotes from the text “Mans Search for Meaning” that were meaningful and why

    2.  Forest Bathing – (watch short video explaining concept)

        1.  Submit two items (upload both to the drop box)

            1.  Free writing ( thoughts, poems, draw pictures, write music)

            2.  Picture from where you were

4.  PAA – Mindfulness practice – see the explainer video and assignment document – due Oct 8

**\*\* remind them the PAA for last week is due: Nutrition**

# **Unit 4: The Physical Self** 

This section often feels very familiar because we all live in bodies however we are often have complicated relationships with our bodies. This unit attempts to explain some of those complexities

#### **Topic 1. The Physical Self** 

*Watch the Physical Self video*: The video covers some sensitive issues and those who feel triggered by issues around their body should make the instructor aware.

#### Self Care questionnaire 

This is a basic survey that should help students understand what self care entails for the physical body

#### **Topic 2. Physical Activity and Health** 

Work through the three videos in sequence

Watch 23 and half hours video

Watch the first 11 mins of the video Brain Benefits of Exercise

Cardio Respiratory Fitness video

# *Review and Integration \#4.1*

Finding your heart rate and target zone for cardio respiratory training. Its okay if students use digital devices that measure their heart rate (E.g., Fitbit or Apple watch)

Learning Lab: Discussion of the physical self and assessing Cardiorespiratory fitness level

> • Submaximal aerobic test
>
> • Maximal aerobic test

**Personal Application Assignment (PAA):**

This is the second Physical practice consequently has multiple choice options:

1.  Cardiovascular training

2.  Strength training

3.  Yoga/Pilates/flexibility training

Remind students to only complete one of the three physical practice options

Learning Lab Unit \#4

**Fourth Week Zoom session (unit \#4)**

**\* How many had a Canadian Thanks Giving (Turkey, cranberry sauce and mash potatoes with gravey)**

**Today I want to cover Unit 4 however first lets debrief Unit 3:**

**<u>Unit \#3 - debrief</u>**

1.  Quotes from **Mans Search for Meaning**- and why where they important to you

2.  Forest Bathing – in Breakout rooms

    1.  Where did you do your forest bathing ( share pictures in your group)

    2.  Briefly describe the experience ?

3.  PAA – Mindfulness practice

    1.  How many have had previous experience with Mindfulness or meditation practices?

    2.  Which option did you choose and why and what was the impact (for example would you continue this practice

    3.  Mindfullness-

        1.  is paying attention which is a central theme of this course. Paying attention to your body, your surroundings.

        2.  Is a skill that requires practice to become proficient, just like shooting a basketball, it takes repetition. Start small 10 to 20 seconds, be patient with your monkey mind.

**<u>Unit \#4 The Physical Self</u>**

We all have embodied stories. This corporeality of our lived experience is the primary way we interact and interpret the world around us. Before we discuss our basic biological rhythms, we need to be aware of our complex relationship we have to our bodies.

3 topics in this unit

1.  *Physical self* – video and self care questionnaire

2.  *Physical Movement for Health* -central message is just move and do it regularly

    1.  23 and half hours video

    2.  Brain Benefits of exercise ( only watch the first 11 mins of this video)

3.  *Cardiorespiratory training* –

    1.  Video

    2.  Heart Rate assessment with calculating your target heart zone

        1.  This is important way to know how much physical activity do you need to maintain your health

**Assessments for this unit**

1.  Review an integration – Self Care Plan ( this is based of of the self care questionnaire) – due Oct 15

2.  PAA – Physical practices with 3 options but only **choose one**

    1.  Cardiorespiratory training

    2.  Muscle fitness training

    3.  Yoga or Pilates or Flexibility training

\* remind them the PAA for last week is due: Mindfulness

# **Unit 5: Strategies for Wellbeing** 

In this unit we start using the building blocks of wellbeing to create a personal structure of thriving. Because the two strategies come from different domains, physical and psychological, its important to highlight their effect on the “lived experience” of wellbeing and not see them as two separate blocks. They share common territory which is their common impact on our wellbeing.

#### **Topic 1. Positive Psychology** 

*Read What is Positive Psychology*

Have them read this article with the PAA in mind for this week

#### **Topic 2. Physical Activity – Muscle Fitness** 

Watch the series of videos on Muscle fitness

1.  Introduction to Muscle fitness and functional health

2.  Benefits of muscle fitness

3.  Muscle physiology

4.  Muscle training programs.

This is another practice where we see significant variation in experience. Some students will have none and some will have vast experience with strength training. The current resources are primarily aimed at the novice. Important for students with significant experience to see how it applies to their health outcomes vs their performance outcomes.

# 

# *Review and Integration \#5.1* 

Create a one session strength program using the video above and complete the following categories

1.  Total body activity

2.  Squatting exercises

3.  Hinge exercises

4.  Push exercises

    1.  Vertical

    2.  Horizontal

5.  Pull exercises

    1.  Vertical

    2.  Horizontal

6.  Core exercises

7.  Grip exercises

Learning lab:- discuss the positive psychology strategies for the PAA assignment. Help students developing a personal muscle fitness program through exploring the TWU fitness center or Home based activities, which is the R&I assignment for this unit

**Personal Application Assignment (PAA): Positive Psychology**

**This is the second psychology practice and includes multiple options. Make sure they read through the options and the explainer video**

Remind them that each option includes a three page report:

1.  Title page

2.  Recording page ( when, where, what and how)

# **Unit 6: Human Connection & the Inner Life** 

Research has shown that human connection is one of the most profound predictors or our wellbeing. Family is often the source of our habits and patterns in life and a significant contributor to our sense of self. Spiritual identity is knowing our place in the universe and for us believers in the sight of God. Much of our spiritual identity is connected to our family identities

#### **Topic 1. Arc of Relationships – Family** 

Family of origin is foundational to how construct our “ways of living” or “being” in the world. For many students, family will be a fundamental support structure for them however some students have experienced significant trauma from these families of origin. Instructors need to be sensitive to this and allow for alternative exercises to the two R&I assignments. (E.g., alternative assignments: Looking glass self assessment. Who are the people who know us and what do they say about us: Coach, Employer, Teachers, etc.?)

*Watch video on Arc of relationships- Family*

*Watch video on Parenting Styles and Attachment Theory*

# *Review and Integration \#6.1- in quiz format* 

> 1\. What are the parenting styles listed in the video and which one best described the home you were raised in?
>
> 2\. What are the attachment styles listed in the video and which one best describes the relationship you had with your primary care giver?
>
> 3\. What parenting style would you prefer to use if you ever decide to have children of your own.
>
> 4\. What parenting style were you parented in
>
> 5\. What parenting style would you like to parent in when you have children
>
> 6\. What style of attachment did you have with your primary care giver?
>
> 7\. What is one insight I have gained from thinking about attachment theory and parenting styles that influences my understanding of what I need for wellbeing and flourishing?

#### **Topic 2. Spiritual Identity** 

Again this is an area of great diversity among our students and the goal of this topic is for them to develop a personal sense of spirituality and to learn how to use that to enhance their personal wellbeing.

Learning lab – Discuss role of family in our sense of identity and our spiritual sense of identity

**Personal Application Assignment (PAA): Contemplative Practice**

Contemplative Practices provide the self-awareness to develop inner life experiences objectively and mindfully, and patterns of behaviors and habits of consciousness. Choose one of the four options. Remind them that each has an assignment document and an explainer video for all of them.

• Forest bathing

• Silence and solitude

• Spiritual practices

• Aesthetic appreciation

**Learning Lab Unit \#6**

**Sixth Week Agenda - Unit \#6 (Oct 29)**

**<u>Review Unit \#5 Strategies for Wellbeing - two areas Positive Psychology and Physical Health</u>**

1.  Physical Health – Strength Training section- any questions

    1.  R&I - Create your own strength program and participate in it

        1.  Record what you did for each area- find options Under Strength Programs in the ppt for the strength training videos

        2.  Answer the reflection questions

    2.  PAA Positive Psychology Strategies – which one did you choose and why?

        2.  Flow Practice

        3.  Acts of Kindness

        4.  Social Connections

**<u>Unit \#6 Human Connection and the Inner Life - Relationships and Spiritual identity</u>**

1.  **Arc of relationships** – probably the most important element of our wellbeing because we are social animals which means we seek connection and belonging. The human species has patterns of these connections and the groups we form eg build moral systems with hierarchies of power or status however unique in the animal kingdom with our multiple non kin groups. But we also have individual patterns of connecting to others. Most of these patterns are learned inside our families and later friends. We are going to cover your relationships throughout your lifespan starting with your parents then friends and finally romantic relationships. In this unit we will focus on your family. We are not looking to critique your family however in this course one of the central themes is self awareness. To understand yourself you have to start by looking at your family of origin. Your family of origin will be where we develop and mimic the patterns of relationships demonstrated to us. Just a caveat, for most of us our families are a source of personal strength however for some, families can be a source of trauma. The reality for most us it is a combination. However I want to address those who don’t want to relive their personal trauma so if that’s you send me an email and we can provide alternative content and assignments. The Arc of relationships contains the family systems and the parenting styles information

    1.  Family systems-two videos, first is on the African concept of “Ubuntu” and second on Family systems- can you play the 2<sup>nd</sup> one video?

    2.  Parenting Styles and attachment theory – this video is important for the R&I assignment for this week.

2.  **Spiritual Identity –**

    1.  Video – short on Christian view of spiritual identity

    2.  Chapter in Book Devine Embrace by Webber – this article goes into more detail on the significance of what Christ did for us on the

3.  Assessment for this week

    1.  R&I Parenting Styles and attachment theory Quiz (4 questions)

4.  Forest bathing  

5.  Silence and solitude  

6.  Spiritual practices  

7.  Aesthetic appreciation 

This will be our last PAA assignment and next week you will choose one of the many practices in the PAAs you have attempted so far and practice it for 4 weeks. This will be the Flourishing Proposal assignment and then report on this four week practice in the final Portfolio.

# **Unit 7: The Environment and the Human Condition**

We have now completed the PAA’s and move onto the Flourishing proposal assignment. The information this week will help them in completing the Flourishing proposal.

#### **Topic 1. Technology**

#### For some students this will be the most significant content for them learning to manage their wellbeing. Learning to control the use of their technology will have the largest impact on their flourishing and the behavior change content is designed to help them in this process. 

*Watch video “Technology & Wellbeing”*

*Watch video “Brief History of Technology and Cities”*

*Review and Integration 7.1 assignment: Technology quiz*

- 4 questions that arise from the two videos above

#### **Topic 2. Behavior Change:**

#### **This content is designed to help them complete their Flourishing Proposal assignment** 

# *Watch video “Behavior Change Theories*

*Watch video “Habit Formation”*

*Read article “Identity Based Habits”*

# *Behavior Change exercise: Choose One behavior you Wish to Change*

This assignment is a mini version of the larger flourishing proposal assignment. They often want to complete the assignment without having watched the presentation. Its important when marking the assignment to highlight if they are applying the Behavior Change content.

***Learning Lab:*** how technology effects your wellbeing. What strategies could you use to change your patterns of technology usage to improve your wellbeing. We will also discuss the flourishing proposal assignment.

**Flourishing Proposal Assignment:**

Introduce the assignment this week, reminding them it is due next week. This assignment is the next step in scaffolding the PAAs into a more focused four week practice. The three important elements in this assignment are: first the practice routine will aid in compliance and resilience of the practice. Second, the evidenced based empirical support for the practice. Lastly, a tracking sheet that reflects the scope of the practice and should include episodic personal evaluations (a comments section for at minimum each week). Its important to remind students this flourishing proposal is then scaffolded even further into the Final Portfolio (it is actually cut and pasted into the final portfolio.)

Encourage them to read through assignment document and watch the explainer video for the Flourishing Proposal

Learning Lab Unit \#7

**7<sup>th</sup> week Unit \#7 agenda**

**<u>Review Unit \#6 Human Connection and the Inner Life - Relationships and Spiritual identity</u>**

1.  **Arc of relationships** – Family systems and Parenting styles

2.  **Spiritual Identity** – We perceive God like our parent and often relate to him with the style of attachment that we experienced as a child. This can be very problematic as our parents weren’t perfect and that is why I recommend studying theology, “Who is the Christian God” . Modern day Evangelicals often emphasis a personal experience with God, which limits God to our past experience and ich is good however it needs to be balanced with a strong theology or understanding of a biblical view of who God is.

3.  **Assessment for this week**

    1.  R&I Parenting Styles and attachment theory Quiz (4 questions)

        1.  Based on the parenting styles video in the first topic

\*Which quadrant of parenting where you in? and which would you like to parent in?

2.  PAA for this week Contemplative practices – can you see the explainer video?

> Choose one of the following:  

4.  Forest bathing  

5.  Silence and solitude  

6.  Spiritual practices  

7.  Aesthetic appreciation 

Which practice did you choose – this is important for your mental hygiene. As we move into the high stress time of the semester at the same time as the days are darker with more rain (here in BC) managing your mental health or inner life is very important to your resiliency in this last month of the semester

**<u>Unit \#7 The Environment and the Human Condition</u>**

Wellbeing is an intentional or volitional, its not something that just happens to you. However the intentional component is not just wanting something to happen. There is a saying in motivational psychology “Environment trumps intention every time” what this means your intention must be to change your environment which then will result in a change in behavior. You can’t just change your behavior with out changing the antecedents to that behavior. If I want good grades I have to have the study habits and sleep habits that promote good grades. I have to organize my environment to help me make the decisions I want to make.

1.  **Technology** – Digital environments are far more accessible then they where previously and that digital space has been commercialized to hold your attention ( billions of dollars of research has gone into holding your attention to that small screen). This makes it imperative for us to have the self management skills to use technology for our wellbeing.

    1.  Technology for Wellbeing – video

        1.  Recommend the Netflix documentary “The Social Dilemma” I have a trailer for it on You Tube.

    2.  Technology and Cities- video on how technology has always been with us and shaped the human species.

2.  **Behavior Change** – in this topic we cover the concept of Self Management skills. With two primary strategies, Choice Architecture and Identity formation

    1.  Behavior change theories video – Nudge theory

    2.  Habit formation – video by James Clear and then Article on using Identities to change behavior.

    3.  Habit formation exercise – choose one behavior to change and using the science of behavior change to craft a plan to change behavior. This is a good practice exercise for the “Flourishing Proposal” assignment that we will introduce this week

3.  **Assessments for the week**

    1.  Review and integration – quiz on Technology usage from the two videos under the Technology topic- Due Nov 5

    2.  Flourishing Proposal – three page assignment due next week Nov 12

        1.  Choosing one practice that you did in the PAA’s or some other behavioral practice that you want to participate in and track for the next four weeks. Remember this is just the plan not the actual 4 week tracking of the practice which will come later as you will put this all into the final portfolio.

# **Unit 9: The Story of You**

The primary assignment for the topics in this unit is R&I \# 9:2 writing their personal story. Help students see the topics in this unit in light of their own personal story.

#### **Topic 1. Arc of Relationships- Building Positive Relationships** 

This is the 2<sup>nd</sup> part of our Arc of Relationship series and is specific to the emerging adult.

*Watch “What makes a Good Life” by Robert Waldinger*

*Watch “Building Positive Relationships” video*

*Review and Integration \#9.1 Relationship questionnaire -*This questionnaire is directly tied to the second video under building positive relationships

*Watch the “Romantic Relationships” video – this video is optional for students*

The first video shows the benefits of long-term relationships and the second video covers the topic of social identity, social skills and romantic relationships

#### 

#### **Topic 2. Gender and Wellbeing** 

Many religious students will be wary of this topic because of the conflict around gender identity in the larger culture. Remind them this is not a discussion on the morality of gender identity but a personal analysis of how gender has impacted their personal stories.

# *Review and Integration \#9:2 Self Story* 

This assignment has two steps: first to write their personal story and then to read through others stories and ask a question. Important they watch the video before starting to write their story. Some students will find this easy and some very difficult. For those struggling where to begin, recommend the four prompts on the moodle site as a starting point. Remind them that someone else will be reading through their story so don’t reveal anything you don’t want other people to know about. Don’t limit the length of the story because some people will write out extended versions of themselves and find this to be a very positive exercise.

The second part is to read through their peers stories and in the Reflect and Connect topic thread reply with at least one theme or pattern or commonality between many of the stories.

**<u>Learning lab : 9<sup>th</sup> week Unit \#9 agenda</u>**

**Unit \#8 Review – Sleep and Leisure**

Unit \#9 – Story of you

Our personal narratives provide us with motivation and limitations to the world around us. They also are the lenses (pair of glasses) to understanding the world around us. These our a significant part of the stories we tell ourselves. These stories are derived from the people, environment and past experiences. This unit looks at your personal story.

**Topic \#1 Relationships- Arc of relationships – building positive relationships**

1.  *The Waldering Ted talk* relates the research evidence on the primary role of relationships in our sense of wellbeing.

2.  *Building Positvie relationships video* – discusses the key social skills required for healthy long term relationships.

3.  *Romantic relationships* video- disucsses the concept of romantic competence. One of the main rites of passage for the emerging adult is to navigate a romantic relationship and how these are different from normal relationships.

- Relationship Questionnaire exercise asks you questions about your level of social skills and romantic competence.

> **Topic \#2 Gender and wellbeing** – discusses the role of gender in our personal wellbeing

1.  Jimmy Kimmel video – Youtube difference between a boy and girl

# **Unit 10: Suffering, Wellbeing and Meaning**

The primary activity is to have the students watch the 2016 movie “Silence” by Martin Scorsese. This is a 3 hr movie and will be the principal content we will provide for the unit. Remind them the two assignments “impressions of the movie” and the major assignment is the “reflections of the movie” are all directly tied to them watching the movie.

.

#### **Topic 1. The Movie Silence** 

1.  Encourage them to watch the 5 min intro to the movie by Dr Dwight Friesen

2.  Watch the movie - Have them look in the syllabus for ways to find the movie. As of this writing here are the platforms you can find the movie on:

> *Scorsese, M. (Director) (2016). Silence. \[Film\]. SharpSword Films. \*Amazon prices subject to change (current when syllabus was released). You may need to rent Silence from iTunes (Rental approx. \$4.99 CAD). Please note that there may be an alternate assignment with alternate rental costs (\$8.99 USD) so do not rent until we have discussed this in*
>
> *class.*

####  

> This is a graphic movie with scenes of torture and decapitation. If students are uncomfortable with the content, they can watch an alternative documentary “In Pursuit of Silence” (see the Moodle Site for the where to find the documentary and the related assignment).

# ***Review and Integration assignment - Movie Silence Impressions assignment***

# Write a 100 word impression of the movie that should be completed immediately after watching the movie and encourage them to just free write on how the movie impacted them. It’s best to have the students complete the impressions assignment before they watch the Resources to the movie. 

3.  *Resources for the movie Silence*

    1.  These resources provide valuable background information and are helpful in completing the Silence reflection assignment

        1.  Article on the Shimabara Rebellion in Japan

        2.  Interview with Andrew Garfield the main actor

        3.  Interview with Martin Scorsese the director of the movie

**Assignment due Next week: Reflections on the movie *Silence***

This is an in-depth analysis of the movie, its major themes and how they relate to our theme of flourishing. There are technically five options students can choose for this analysis. It is important for them to identify which option they are choosing to respond to in the paper. Also when they cite the Movie they should show time stamps or at least briefly describe the scene in the movie they are referring to. Encourage students to not complete this assignment until they have finished Topic \#1 Suffering in Unit 11.

**Learning Lab: 10<sup>th</sup> week Unit \#10 agenda**

**<u>Unit \#9 review</u>**

2.  *Read two other classmates stories and ask them a question about their story with a reply – by Wednesday Nov 23*

3.  *Answer at least two of these questions – by Friday Nov 25*

<!-- -->

2.  **Leisure/sleep tracker assignment** Debrief – have them review their assignment for the following questions ( could put this in the chat for zoom)

    1.  *Socially*

        1.  Are you an introvert or extrovert? Do you use leisure to recharge with friends or alone

        2.  Who are your friends that you connect with during leisure time and how do they influence you?

    2.  *Existential* - what does your leisure time use reveal about the purpose in your life

        1.  Does your leisure time move you toward or away or is it neutral with your priorities in life?

        2.  How did you categorized spiritual practices; as leisure or existence activities. Why or why not?

    3.  *Salutogenic* (moves you toward wellbeing) vs Pathogenic (moves you away from wellbeing)

        1.  What percentage of your leisure time is salutognic to your flourishing and why

        2.  What percentage is counter productive, or pathogenic, to your flourishing and why

**<u>Unit \#10 Suffering, wellbeing and meaning</u>**

We now take a turn in this course away from things we can control to things that happen to us out of our control. “To Be Human is to Suffer” buddist saying. We all experience pain, loss, and failure. We broached the topic with our text book “Mans Search for Meaning”. Now we want to take a deep dive into suffering with a 2016 movie “Silence” by Martin Scorsese. I love movies because they engage me into stories in deeper ways (emotionally and psychologically) than almost any other medium. We choose this movie for three reasons.

1.  It’s an historical Christian story that is fictionalized, while many of the specific events are adapted the historical setting is accurate.

2.  It is a multilayered approach to suffering and will require postformal thinking about existential issues ( Postformal thinking requires-logical flexibility, and willingness to nuance moral and intellectual complexities- there is no one right answer but must be processed in your own way)

Review of Unit 10

- Any questions on the Movie Silence Reflection

Unit \#11 Building Resiliency and imagining a future Self

The first topic in this unit is Resiliency. Central to the concept of personal resiliency is having a purpose or meaning system. The second topic in this unit is the “Future Self” which is based on goals interacting with our environment. This is a very uncertain process because you couldn’t imagine how you have changed in the last five years and won’t image how much you will change in the next 5 years. So imagining our future selves is filled with uncertainty and even personal doubt. This is where these two topics combine. To imagine, strategize and plan for our future we need a certain sense of purpose or guiding principles. The best example is college. If you want to be successful and even survive college (when it gets hard, like exam time that we are all heading into) it really helps if you know why your are doing it. Cultivate ( or spend some time thinking about it processing the big picture of your life) your purpose or guiding principles and this will make wayfinding significantly simpler and be successful at college
