# Learning Lab Activities Guide: 
# Learning Lab Week 1 - Unit 1 & 2 – Navigating course & Intro: socio imagination & Culture 
### Unit 1: Navigating Course Syllabus, Textbooks, Journals, Participation, Moodle, Quizzes, etc. 
### Unit 1: Ice breaker-Develop definition of Sociological Imagination as class 
- Sociology Term: “Sociological imagination” is an attempt to look differently about everyday life, “to steer away from thinking routinely about our everyday lives” (Q & T, 2018, p. 4) … to be able to connect the “large” and “small” events in our lives, the rapid changes and the slow changes, to think about how we have been influenced by society around us.  
- Sociology 101 Ss, think about this and try to imagine how this class might shape us and how we can shape the class for optimum impact and learning.  Prof. Dr. Todd Martin really wants to challenge your thinking about sociological issues … for you to be impacted by it!  Possibly, you have come to this class with some anxiety and uncertainty.  [Ask class]: “What are some anxiety and uncertainty you have, maybe questions about Sociology 101 online with TWU in Canada that are being facilitated on TWU’s ‘FAR’ campus(es)?  Please, any of your questions or anxieties you have in coming to this class.  
- Please discuss this in pairs with a person on one side of you for a few minutes and then we’ll share them together as a whole.” [Examples: What is Soc 101 all about?  Will it be boring?  Will I understand it?  How much work is there?  Can I pass or excel in it?  Who is this Facilitator & why is s/he here when the real professor is in Canada?]  
- Let’s do some redirecting of our thinking!  Instead of wondering or worrying about whether you will do okay in this course, let’s determine today on this first class to help one another to succeed!  As your Academic Facilitator (AF), I want you to enjoy and to succeed in this course.  Plus, sure I’m worried about whether you all will like me!  We’re all going through lots of adjustments but let’s decide today together to help one another to succeed.  We can have a part in shaping the success of this class – my success as the AF and your success as Ss.  Don’t just think about you getting a good grade – I mean, yes, do your very best – but let’s help one another get good grades in this course. Okay? How can we help one another and how can you help me and how can I help you to succeed in Soc 101?
- Now, If I do or say something that is culturally offensive or inappropriate, please tell me right away!  Or if I, have you do some group learning activity that really is boring or does not go well or maybe it doesn’t make sense. So please let me know because I want this class to be a wonderful learning experience for all of us!  Don’t you?  Of course, we all do!   
### Unit 2: Case study: The Sacred “Rac”
http://www.drabruzzi.com/sacred_rac.html 
Trick: “Rac” spelled opposite is “Car” 
### Unit 2: Case study: Wild Child Genie
1. Language as a social construct. 
2. The primary function of language is communication rather than representation, so language is essentially a social phenomenon.

https://www.verywellmind.com/genie-the-story-of-the-wild-child-2795241 
Questions to discuss: 
- What sorts of help should communities provide to individuals and families in which one member is acting in a way that is unhealthy for others? 
- Where is the line between individual freedom and protecting the "larger society," which, in some instances, may just be the family?
*** Remind and explain students to do Quizzes 1-3, and plan things ahead. ***

# Learning Lab Week 2 - Unit 3: Socialization
### Unit 3: Self-Socialization Activity:  Who Am I? (Grab an item near you to represent either inner or outer you and share)
The theoretical concept of self-socialization suggests that an individual is able to reflect on the self, formulate a vision of a future self, set goals, and take actions that create or alter the developmental trajectory.
### Unit 3: Identity-Brainstorm social media platforms that students like to use. Discuss selfies. 
### Unit 3: Deviance-Case Study 

*** Remind and explain students to do Quizzes 4 & 5, 1st Reflective Journal, Social Issue Paper-Proposal, and Unit Test # 1 (Chapter 1-5), which Dr. Martin would drop by to give more details about. ***

# Learning Lab Week 3 - Unit 4: Inequality
### Unit 4: Economic Inequality-You are now operating a Canadian family! 
- Each breakout room is a Canadian family, which includes four-five members (2 adults [assuming 1 male + 1 female] and 2-3 children), and the pre-settings of monthly salaries (after tax) and occupations (Women make 89 cents on average for every dollar made by a man.) With participants working in break-out rooms as families, getting a life situation card once a “week” and tracking down on the financial status of their families after each time change. At the end of a period of time in “3 months” (12 times of picking the cards), each break-out room finalize a result on their families financially and share the experience with peers in large group.
- Life happens cards: https://pickerwheel.com/pw?id=9VHjE 
- Break-out room 1 pre-setting: Female part-time warehouse staff ($2,500) + Male financial advisor ($3,500) 
- Break-out room 2 pre-setting: Female early childhood teacher ($3,800) + Male currently not eligible to work because of health conditions ($0)
- Break-out room 3 pre-setting: Male dentist ($8,300) + Female housewife ($0)
- Break-out room 4 pre-setting: Male legal parallel assistant ($3,400) + Female health care worker ($3,600) 
### Unit 4: Gender Inequality and Education 
1.	“Being Born as a Girl in China.” (2.5 minutes):  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAaArElF__8 
2. “Gender Inequality in India.” (2.5 minutes):  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehtuxMYKuZo 
- Do you agree with it? 
- Does it accurately portray how it really is in China (or India)? 
- According to the news report from 2014, why do you think the nation was downgraded in gender equality?  What can be done to improve things? 
- Can you give an example of gender inequality that you have observed?
3. Violence against Women, (especially indigenous women in Canada): 
[Note to Facilitator: Several links to videos and statements; make sure internet works and/or download all these links/videos on to the laptop prior to class: 
- 2-minute UN produced video from Nepal has a number of different kinds of people talking about violence and harassment and what should be done - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDin7ywhRds.  
- UN-sponsored 4-minute YouTube video I’d like us to view together – https://youtu.be/ffW2mBZLWIc – but I will stop the video several times to highlight things it talks about that are also discussed in our text.
- Distressing topic of Violence against Indigenous Women in Canada is dealt with on pp. 179-180 of Sociology course text. This is a grave concern in Canada. There is a short clip with Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau announcing an official inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women & girls - https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/08/canada-40m-inquiry-violence-indigenous-women-justin-trudeau 
### Unit 4: Racial & Ethnic Inequality
1.	(Sept. 11th 2001 Terrorist attack on the World Trade Centre twin towers): The world was riveted to TV and radio news stations in the wake of the terrible terrorist attacks on the New York City’s twin Trade Center towers on September 11th, 2001 – known commonly and simply as 9/11.  Without showing any too-gruesome footage, here is a 1-minute mini-report from Dan Rather that a fellow named Nathan Flach posted on YouTube on September 12th in 2010: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idokOg_Nf_k
People were paralyzed with fear those first days, followed by a backlash of hate toward Muslims and anyone who looked Arab.  Even peace-loving, law-abiding Sikhs were mistakenly equated as Muslims, and some were targeted and even killed.  For many Americans, there is still a lot of anti-Muslim and anti-Arab sentiment.  When will this anger and hatred against other races or religions and human beings end?  
2.	Now (presuming our Learning Lab is in Chandigarh or New Delhi, North India or other locations depending on the diverse of the class) in India, there are issues of ethnic or racial animosity and violence, are there not? Historically, has there not been war or animosity between India and certain other countries, such as Pakistan, or China or Russia?  How do Indians feel about certain “other” races or ethnicities?  Or is there at all a divide between North Indians and South Indians, how about between these West regions of Delhi, Rajasthan, Haryana or Panjab and eastern states like Bihar, Sikkim, Assam, Nagaland or Manipur? 
*** Remind and explain students to do Quizzes 6-8, 2nd Reflective Journal, and plan things ahead. ***
# Learning Lab Week 4 - Unit 4: Global Inequality & Unit 5: Family Institution
### Unit 5: Family Institution
- Group discussion: Smaller Families … groups of 3 or 4, discuss: 
1. Why have families gotten smaller?
2. Compare/contrast Canada and China (or India or other countries) to talk what are some similar and different reasons for family size decreasing in these countries?  
*** Remind and explain students to do Quizzes 9 & 10, 3rd Reflective Journal, Social Issue Paper-Outline, and Unit Test # 2 (Chapter 6-10), which Dr. Martin would drop by to give more details about. ***

# Learning Lab Week 5 - Unit 5: Education, Work/Economy, Religion Institutions
### Unit 5: Education Institution
1. Group discussion: Education not only helps one get  a job, but Quan-Hasse & Tepperman (2018) state, “Besides this, education provides a kind of pre-job socialization” (p. 267).  “The commodification of education is the idea that we buy degrees [to] open up opportunities to earn a living.”
- Does education contribute to inequality; does education raise poverty or lower it? Explain. 
- Do you think making university tuition-free would lessen the gap between the rich and the poor?
2. Presuming TWU launches mini campus in China (Hong Kong and Beijing), and our Learning Lab would be conducted there in-person instead of the remote learning now. What difficulties are we facing? Do you think the divide between North China and South China would cause troubles in the mini campus? How do Chinese feel about certain “other” races or ethnicities? What about students between the West provinces of Muslim Xinjiang, Ningxia, Gansu, or Qinghai and Eastern provinces like Liaoning, Jilin, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, or Fujian? For this discussion, please partners up for a frank discussion of racism, especially about its origins and what drives or motivates racial tensions?  
- Research in Canada has shown that students from families with a household higher income are more likely to attend college or university than students from poorer families.
- Based on what you’ve learned so far, do you think difference would disappear if post-secondary education were made cost-free to all interested students? 
- From your personal sociological perspective, how is education  similar & different in Canada versus China?
### Unit 5: Work Institution

George Ritzer & ‘The McDonaldization of Work’ [From Oxford Textbook (p. 300)]:
1. McDonald’s is famous for 4 elements: 
i.	Efficiency – minimizing the time to fill an order
ii.	Calculated – exact quantities on a burger or sandwich
iii.	Predictable – no matter where you go, the food is the same
iv.	Control – standardized equipment & training in using it & serving
2. McDonaldization suggests modern employment includes these 4 elements: 
i.	Efficiency – getting more done in less amount of time required
ii.	Calculated – workers have quotas or requirements for things done
iii.	Predictable – many work tasks are routine, repetitive & easy to learn
iv.	Control – standardized processes so that workers can easily be replaced
- Group discussion: The Industrial Revolution and Technological advances dramatically changed people’s lives. After 8 weeks of Sociology_101, now do some Sociological Imagination! (Quan-Hasse and Tepperman, 2018, pp. 294, 296). What do you think the impact of the Industrial Revolution was on the working lives of those who lived through them? 
### Unit 5: Religion Institution-Group/Brek-out rooms interactive teaching
1. Break-out room 1-Functionalism: Emile Durkheim’s totemism = symbols used in religious rituals unite certain members of society with regard to their meaning and beliefs. 
- What are some religious symbols and their meaning? 
- Do you think people working in secular society should be allowed (or not) to wear religious symbols or dress?
2. Break-out room2-Conflict Theory: Karl Marx is often quoted saying: “Religion is the opium of the people.”  The fuller quotation: "Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people.” 
- What do you think Marx is saying about religion? How is religion used at times to control people?
- When or where has religion greatly benefitted people?
3. Break-out room 3-Symbolic Interactionism: These theorists view religions as filling people’s need for meaning and provides a way to understand and cope with life.
- How does religion bring meaning to some people? 
- Who are religious leaders of today or in history that have been good (righteous) role models?  Explain.
4. Break-out room 4-Feminist Theory: Many in feminism make the charge that most religions have oppressed or discriminated against women, excluding them in religious leadership.
- How do you feel about women pastors, priests, mullahs, gurus, monks or rabbis? 
- Why do you think in most religions, the number of practicing women far outnumber practicing men?
*** Remind and explain students to do Quizzes 11-13, and plan things ahead. ***

2.	Watch Netflix: The Social Dilemma trailer (documentary-drama hybrid explores the dangerous human impact of social networking, with tech experts sounding the alarm on their own creations) to trigger the discussions among the groups. 
3.	Questions for Discussion:
