## Academic Integrity and Avoiding Plagiarism at TWU
One of the core values of Trinity Western University is the integration of academic excellence with high standards of personal, moral, and spiritual integrity. The University considers it a serious offence when an individual attempts to gain unearned academic credit. It is the student’s responsibility to be informed about what constitutes academic dishonesty.

## Unit I - Learning Lab #1 (LL = 1-1.5 hour) – Intro. to Sociology
1. HOOK: Sociological Imagination [develop definition as class] - “A Difficult Patient” 
[Facilitator DkS’ Introduction – his notes are highlighted in green colour]: 
In the course textbook, authors Quan-Haase and Tepperman (2018, p. 11) define Sociology as “a study of the interrelationships among individuals and groups.” They explain it is not difficult but is “familiar and simple” – they give the example of the relationship of a doctor & a patient. Let’s watch together this Friends’ 4-minute video.  While watching it, we want to think about these 2 opposite points or perspectives and discuss together the 2 questions. 
‘Friends’ … https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ2msARQsKU: [discuss Q’s in pairs] 
- What things in this clip is true or typical scenario in a visit to the doctor?
- What things in this clip is unusual or not something you’d expect?
[1 comment on each Q from each group; write answers on White-board; all share.] 

2. The 4 Theories: Sociological Approaches [Review the 4 theories & key theorists]
‘4 Approaches to Sociology’ – Conflict Theory, Functional Theory, Symbolic Interactionism, and Feminism: Briefly mention that every unit considers them, so best to get to know them early!

3. Sociology Term [Facilitator DkS’ Introduction]: “Sociological imagination” is an attempt to look differently about everyday life, “to steer away from thinking routinely about our everyday lives” (Q & T, 2018, p. 4) … to be able to connect the “large” and “small” events in our lives, the rapid changes and the slow changes, to think about how we have been influenced by society around us.  
Sociology 101 Ss, think about this and try to imagine how this class might shape us and how we can shape the class for optimum impact and learning.  Prof. Dr. Todd Martin really wants to challenge your thinking about sociological issues … for you to be impacted by it!  Possibly, you have come to this class with some anxiety and uncertainty.  [Ask class]: “What are some anxiety and uncertainty you have, maybe questions about Sociology 101 online with TWU in Canada that are being facilitated on TWU’s ‘FAR’ campus(es)?  Please, any of your questions or anxieties you have in coming to this class.  
Please discuss this in pairs with a person on one side of you for a few minutes and then we’ll share them together as a whole.” [Examples?: What is Soc 101 all about?  Will it be boring?  Will I understand it?  How much work is there?  Can I pass or excel in it?  Who is this Facilitator & why is s/he here, when the real professor is in Canada?]  
Let’s do some redirecting of our thinking!  Instead of wondering or worrying about whether you will do okay in this course, let’s determine today on this first class to help one another to succeed!  As your Academic Facilitator (AF), I want you to enjoy and to succeed in this course.  Plus, sure I’m worried about whether you all will like me!  We’re all going through lots of adjustments but let’s decide today together to help one another to succeed.  We can have a part in shaping the success of this class – my success as the AF and your success as Ss.  Don’t just think about you getting a good grade – I mean, yes, do your very best – but let’s help one another get good grades in this course.  Okay?  How can we help one another and how can you help me and how can I help you to succeed in Soc_101?
Now, If I do or say something that is culturally offensive or inappropriate, please tell me right away!  Or if I have you do some group learning activity that really is boring or does not go well – maybe it doesn’t make sense – please let me know because I want this class to be a wonderful learning experience for all of us!  Don’t you?  Of course we all do!  

Re-watch ‘Most Canadian Word is Welcome-Bienvenue!’ video-clip; using ‘Social Imagination’ have students (Ss) comment on cultural/sociological observations they ‘notice’ in the video. 
4.	‘Sociological Discussion’ – Anxieties & Questions coming to this class & TWU.

5.	Extra [If there is time left]: Probably, there will not be time left, but just in case, the last page of chapter-1 has “Questions for Critical Thought.”  Ss pair-up or in 3’s to discuss Qs #4 &/or #5.
