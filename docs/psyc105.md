### Course Description

Introduction to Psychology, is intended as a broad introduction to the field of psychology. It may be seen as an answer to the questions "What is psychology?" and "What do psychologists do?" Topics considered include: understanding scientific research, the biological basis of behavior, sensation and perception, consciousness, learning, memory, and motivation and emotion (and in Psychology 106, thinking and language, lifespan development, intelligence, personality, behavioral disorders, therapy, and social processes). Attempts will be made throughout to relate the content of psychology to students' everyday experience as well as to a Christian worldview. Of course, to take this course it is not necessary that you be a Christian. Whatever your beliefs, you are encouraged to examine them in light of what you are learning.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:

1.	**Knowledge and Application**
 - Identify basic concepts and research findings, and give examples of psychology’s integrative themes.
 - Apply psychological principles to everyday life.
 - Describe ethical principles that guide psychologists in research and therapy.

2. **Cognitive Complexity**
 - Draw appropriate, logical, and objective conclusions about behaviour and mental processes from empirical evidence.
 - Evaluate misconceptions or erroneous behavioral claims based on evidence from psychological science.
 - Design, conduct, or evaluate basic psychological research.

3. **Spiritual Formation**
 - To explore ways to integrate and articulate a Christian perspective of psychology
 - To consider and evaluate current psychological literature through a Christian worldview
 - To strengthen your understanding of God through reflective integration of psychological phenomena with your personal spirituality

### GRADING GUIDELINES
Following is a description of the letter grading:

| **A range = Superior, exceptional, outstanding**. A+ 90-100%  A 85-89%  A- 80-84% | The assignment demonstrates critical, informed, and creative theological inquiry that reflects superior understanding of essential theological/historical concepts. This means the student demonstrates depth of insight beyond what is normally expected. Carefully nuanced reasoning and writing, free from material, structural and grammatical error are presupposed in this grade. |
|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **B range = Good.**  B+ 77-79%    B 73-76%    B- 70-72%                       | The assignment demonstrates ready command of full range of concepts and shows some critical, informed, and creative inquiry that reflects above average understanding of essential theological/historical concepts. This means the student has produced an assignment that is free from material, structural and grammatical errors.                                                    |
| **C range = Acceptable.**    C+ 67-69%  C 63-66%    C- 60-62%                | The assignment demonstrates satisfactory ability to describe overall picture and essential concepts. This means the student has completed the assignment in a manner involving no significant errors. Material may not be free from structural and grammatical errors. Nuanced reasoning is not demonstrated.                                                                           |
| **D range = Below average**.    D+ 57-59%   D 53-56%    D- 50-52%           | The assignment demonstrates reasoning that is neither carefully nuanced nor coherently presented; writing is insufficient in depth of insight and/or use of texts; presentation is not free from material error in structure, spelling and grammar. This means that the student failed to respond adequately to the assignment and its intentions.                                      |
| **F = Unsatisfactory**.

Students should follow the steps detailed by the Equity of Access Office outlined in the Student Life section of the University Calendar.

# Introduction

In this section, we will outline some key ideas to consider as you facilitate this course. See below for advice on setting up your class schedule, facilitating activities and discussions, and guiding students through Learning Labs.

***NOTE:*** In the past, this course may be offered as part of various sections with various timelines for completion. Please contact the Instructor to identify the best schedule given the unique timeline for your section.

#### **Learning Labs**

Note that students will do part of their learning online, and part in a Learning Lab that you will be facilitating. This is a flipped classroom model where students engage with the content at home by reading the textbook, reading and viewing course materials on Moodle as designed by the instructor, and preparing activities and assignments for the next Learning Lab. In Learning Labs, they will engage in group discussions, assignments, and other activities in order to help them engage with the course material.

***Part 1 - Sample Welcome Message and Orientation to the Course:***

I am excited to be your facilitator for Psych 105. As the course begins, I wanted to take some time now, to walk through this course so you can develop a sense of what is ahead.

This course will be organized into 10 units. Each page of the course will provide you with the following information:

 - A general overview of the topic that will be addressed during the unit.
 - Specific learning outcomes and topics for the unit.
 - Resources that you will need to address learning activities and assessments in the unit.
 - Specific learning activities that you will need to complete each unit at home (before attending your Learning Lab).
 - Information about formal assessments throughout the course.


Over the duration of the course, we will be meeting together for ___ hours per week. During our time together, I will be facilitating group discussions, answering questions, helping you with your assignments, and evaluating your participation in class using the rubric provided on each unit page.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask. I am here to help and be your guide on this journey through your Introduction to Psychology 105 course.

---

***Part 2: Introductions and ICE Breakers***

**NOTE:** *I included this as an option for Facilitators. Depending on the nature of the student’s, or your own personal preferences/experiences, please feel free to use or discard. I would, however, strongly recommend an “introductory activity” or some sort as much of the Learning Lab’s will involve discussion with one another. This is just one sample of what you could use:*

Before we get started today, lets all introduce ourselves and get to know each other. I would like everyone to share a little about who you are and why you are taking this course. If you already know most of your classmates, be sure to include some new information they might not all know about you such as:

 - General information about yourself as a person and a student.
 - What field you intend to “go into” when you graduate.
 - Your biggest question, doubt, or fear about the class.
 - How did you come to enroll in this course or program?
 - Do you have any experience with this topic?
 - What do you hope to gain from this class?

Student’s can then share this information with the class – either their own or have partners share about their partners.

!!! **NOTE:** Please remind students to keep language and “tone” professional and respectful. This might be a good opportunity to “frame” the expectations for the rest of Learning Lab discussions as some topics may be divisive or controversial – student’s need to be made aware that everyone needs to focus on respectful dialogue.

#### **General Expectations**

Prior to beginning each unit, it is strongly recommended that you take a moment to familiarize yourself with the content, and activities, student’s will be participating in. While your primary role will be in facilitating discussion during Learning Lab’s, you will also need to help “troubleshoot” any issues or general questions that arise throughout each unit. Specific notes for each unit will be provided in subsequent sections of this guide.  If any questions arise, please connect with the Instructor ASAP.

**General Overview**

As mentioned in the previous section, take some time, prior to each Learning Lab, to familiarize yourself with the content and guiding questions of that given unit. Learning Lab’s have, intentionally, been left “open” so that student’s can explore and pursue their interests in the content of each unit - It is not the intention to keep these labs as rigid structures! As you will see in each unit, guiding questions have been provided for student’s to ponder and “engage” with.

Please also direct students to the quizzes at the end of each unit. One of the Learning Outcomes in this course is for student’s to develop some familiarity with key terminology in the field of psychology – these quizzes are intended to support that. Also reiterate with the students that they are not part of a formal assessment – they are for practice to prepare for assignments and formal quizzes and tests. You will also see that some chapters from the textbook span two units in this course – as such, not every unit will have a quiz. Please make students aware of this.

#### **Learning Lab Activities**

As you will experience, different groups of student’s bring different opportunities and different challenges. If you develop the sense that  a particular group is willing and able to engage in group dialogue, it may be best to structure conversations so that everyone is contributing and responding to one another. It might also be helpful to structure smaller pairings so dialogue can take place in a more comfortable “intimate” setting before bringing all students together to share their thoughts and ideas.

In other settings, student’s may be more reluctant to engage in group dialogue. As such, your role will involve offering some latitude around what participation looks like. Following-up with prompts such as “why,” or “can you explain or give some examples” is encouraged, this does not always result in for fruitful dialogue. As you will see, the questions are quite “wide” in scope and ask student’s to call upon their own experiences and/or beliefs – due to this nature, some of the following might be options for student’s as well:

 - Drawing a picture
 - Designing a game
 - Creating a skit
 - Developing an app
 - Writing a poem (or song lyrics)
 - Listing words (in English or their first language) that are connected to the question(s).
 - Creating a math formula or using numbers to represent their thoughts.
 - Design an experiment to test their ideas.
 - Anything else that they might be comfortable with in demonstrating their thoughts.

As the facilitator, it is trusted that you will use your own experience, training, and best judgement with respect to which direction you take the Learning Lab’s in. If you are struggling, please always refer to the guiding principle here: it is intended that student’s engage with the course content in a meaningful way and be active participants in their own learning, as well as supporting the learning of their peers. While I understand that this flexibility, at times, can be overwhelming, please do not hesitate to connect with me so we can clarify and discuss.

Ultimately, student’s will be assessed on their openness and willingness to actively participate in a meaningful way – please remind them of this at the start of each Learning Lab as it might serve as a motivator moving forward....


# Learning Labs - Ideas and Suggestions

As mentioned in previous notes, the intent of Learning Labs is to focus on stimulating thought and dialogue. Much of the *"questions"* in this course are open to interpretation - there is no "right" answer. The study of psychology also requires some open-mindedness, compassion, and understanding of the complexities of our relationship with the world around us. Student's have much to learn from one another's thoughts and ideas and, ultimately, that is the hope and intention of our Learning Lab's and the questions that have been provided to guide thought and reflection.

These guiding questions have been left intentionally "open" as I want to encourage student's to explore these areas and, hopefully, stimulate some thought and excitement for the field of psychology. This, however, can be a challenging process if student's are reluctant to participate. Between your skill-set as a facilitator, and my experience as an instructor, it is my hope we can work together to create a positive, engaged atmosphere during Learning Labs to promote personal growth.

Below are some ideas - if you are comfortable, however, please feel free to incorporate your own ideas to encourage learning and growth:

1. [**1-2-4-ALL**](http://www.liberatingstructures.com/1-1-2-4-all/)

This activity helps to:

 - Engage every individual in searching for answers.
 - Avoid overhelping and the overcontrol-dependency vicious cycle.
 - Create safe spaces for expression, diminish power differentials.
 - Express “silent” conversations and expand diversity of inputs.
 - Enrich quality of observations and insights before expression.
 - Build naturally toward consensus or shared understanding.

2. [**Impromptu Networking**](http://www.liberatingstructures.com/2-impromptu-networking/)

This activity is good for:

 - Initiate participation immediately for everyone provided the questions are engaging.
 - Attract deeper engagement around challenges.
 - Invite stories to deepen as they are repeated.
 - Help shy people warm up.
 - Affirm individual contributions to solutions.
 - Emphasize the power of loose and new connections.
 - Suggest that little things can make a big difference.

3. [**User Experience Fishbowl**](http://www.liberatingstructures.com/18-users-experience-fishbowl/)

This activity helps:

 - Get down-to-earth field experience and all the questions and answers about new endeavors out on the table for everyone to understand at the same time.
 - Create conditions for new ideas to emerge.
 - Make space for every participant’s imagination and experience to show up.
 - Build skills in listening, storytelling, pattern-finding, questioning, and observing.
 - Celebrate early adopters and innovators who have gained field experience (often failing forward and vetting the prototype).

4. [**Drawing Together**](http://www.liberatingstructures.com/20-drawing-together/)

This activity helps to:

 - Reveal insight or understanding not accessible with verbal or linear methods.
 - Tap all the sources of knowledge for innovation (explicit, tacit, latent/emergent).
 - Signal that a quest or journey in search of new discoveries is under way.
 - Develop and deepen shared understanding of a vision or complex dynamics.
 - Create closer connections among group members.

!!! *Note: This is a good activity to consider if student's are particularly reluctant to engage in discussion*

! ***The following sections will outline the guiding questions for each unit in the course. As you read through, consider which activity(s) you might consider to facilitate conversation. If you are struggling, please contact the instructor for additional guidance.***

### Suggested Time for Different Online or In Class Lab Activities

As a facilitator, you may need to lead your students in face-to-face interactions, whether online or in a classroom, for up to 2 hours or more. Fortunately, there are numerous questions posed through each of the Units and many ways to address those questions. Below are some suggested timelines for the various activities you can do to enhance student interaction and learning. At the same time, please use your discretion to avoid unnecessarily ending an activity that is going well, or prolonging an activity that requires changing. The activities can be conducted as individual or group exercises. (Please note that “question(s)” is used to allow the opportunity to bundle two or more questions together, when appropriate.)

Drawing a picture – 15 to 30 minutes of drawing, 5 to 10 minutes of discussion per person as to how the drawing relates to the question(s)

Designing a game – 15 to 30 minutes of designing, up to 30 minutes of playing the game (this is dependent upon how many games are made and how many people are in the class)

Developing an interpretive dance – 15 minutes to develop a dance, 5 minutes of performance per person/group, and 5 minutes per person/group to share about how the dance relates to the question(s)

Creating a skit – 30 minutes to create a skit (skits can be funny, however, be sure to keep them respectful and informative – avoid ridicule and discrimination), 5 to 10 minutes to act out the skit, 15 minutes to discuss what it was like to make and act out a skit and what it taught them about the question(s)

Making an app – 15 to 30 minutes of development, 5 to 10 minutes of discussion per person as to how the app addresses the question(s)

Writing some song lyrics or a poem – 15 minutes to write song/poem, 5 minutes of performance per person, and 5 minutes per person to share about how the song/poem relates to the question(s)

Listing words (in English or your first language) that are connected to the question(s) – 10 minutes to write a list of words and 5 minutes to share how those words relate to the question(s)

Making sounds or music – 10 to 15 minutes to compose sounds/music, 5 minutes to perform, and 5 minutes to share how those sounds/music relate to the question(s)

Creating a math formula or use numbers to represent your thoughts – 10 to 15 minutes to formulate and 5 minutes to link the numbers/formula to the question(s)

Design an experiment to test your ideas – 15 to 30 minutes to design an experiment, 5 to 10 minutes to discuss the experiment and how it addresses the question(s)

Discussion – Up to 1 hour of uninterrupted discussion for online/Zoom style interactions (though it may need to be adjusted to 15 to 30-minute blocks of time), in a classroom, it could be for the totality of the meeting time  

# Unit 1: What is Psychology?

***Topic 1***

This topic introduces student's to the field of psychology. As such, the discussion for this week will focus on:

 - What draws people to study psychology? (It is one of the most popular majors in North American universities).
 - What drew you to study psychology?
 - Some people argue that the scientific method is appropriate for studying inanimate objects and simple organisms but not appropriate for studying complex human behavior. What are the strengths and weaknesses of applying the scientific method to the study of people?
 - Some postmodernists argue that since complete objectivity is impossible, science is not an appropriate route to the understanding of human thought and behavior. How would you respond to this criticism?

---

***Topic 2***

This section will introduce student's to different careers in the field of psychology. The focus of discussion will be:


 - For what careers would a psychology major be helpful? (The internet has information on this.)
 - What are the steps necessary to become a psychologist in private clinical practice?
 - What’s the difference between a psychologist and a psychiatrist?
 - Which perspective or level of explanation do you personally find the most interesting? Why?
 - Why are some people wary of psychology?

---

***Topic 3***

 - How useful do you think it is to think of behavior in this way (i.e., as an A-B-C chain of antecedents, behavior, consequences)? How could you take advantage of this way of viewing your behavior, e.g., to change a habit?

## Term Paper

!! **IMPORTANT** - Please have student's look ahead to the Term Paper Assignment, as well as the Final Exam. It is important that they begin planning and focusing their time to complete the final assessments for this course.

---

Student's will be expected to submit a term paper. Please instruct them to visit the "Term Paper" page so they can familiarize themselves with expectations. During one of the Learning Labs (towards the end of the course), please review the writing resources with students (they can also be found on the Term Paper page).

This might be a good opportunity to connect with the instructor to ensure student's are receiving consistent information around expectations.

Depending on the English language skills of the student's, we will set aside additional time, as needed, to ensure we are supporting student learning. I will be relying on your judgment to communicate this....

## Final Exam

Student's should be well aware that there will be a final exam for this course. Please remind student's during their final unit's to ensure there are no surprises...

Remind student's that this exam will consist of 100 multiple choice questions that covers **ALL** content from the course. It is important that they organize their time to prepare for this.

I will also ask that you connect with me to ensure student's know the exact time and date of this exam. Each delivery structure of this course will be unique so we will discuss supervision and exam delivery on a section-by-section basis.
